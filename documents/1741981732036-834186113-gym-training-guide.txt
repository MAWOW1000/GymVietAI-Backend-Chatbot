## Important Notes for Beginners

1. **Warm-up**: Always start with 5-10 minutes of light cardio and dynamic stretching.

2. **Focus on Form**: Proper technique is more important than lifting heavy weights. Start with lighter weights to master the form.

3. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink water before, during, and after your workout.

4. **Rest**: Allow 48 hours of rest for muscle groups you've trained intensely.

5. **Nutrition**: Ensure you're consuming adequate protein to support muscle recovery and growth.

6. **Progression**: Gradually increase weight or repetitions as exercises become easier.

7. **Listen to Your Body**: If you feel pain (not to be confused with muscle fatigue), stop the exercise and reassess your form.

Remember that consistency is key to seeing results. Stick to your workout schedule and make adjustments as needed based on your progress and goals.
