Preface to ”Physical Activity, Physical Fitness, andExercise Interventions for Preserving Human Healthand Preventing and Treating Chronic Conditionsacross the Lifespan”
Increasing  global  physical  activity  levels  is  one  of  the  most  important  public  health  goals  of
the 21st century. Physically active individuals present better sleep patterns, increased wellbeing andquality of life, as well as better physical function and fitness levels. In addition, physical activity mightstimulate brain function and improve both cognition and mental health.  The risk of many chronicdiseases is also reduced in physically active individuals, and physical activity might counteract thedetrimental metabolic effects of long sedentary periods.
Physical fitness is not only a key marker of health in healthy individuals,  but in people with
chronic conditions.  Compelling evidence indicates that low levels of both cardiorespiratory fitnessand muscular strength are associated with an increased risk of morbidity and premature mortality fora variety of causes, including cardiovascular diseases and cancer.  Consequently, preserving fitnesslevels throughout life is a major clinical and public health interest.
Exercise interventions represent the most efficient form of physical activity to enhance physical
fitness and improve health outcomes at all ages and chronic statuses. However, exercise prescriptionin many populations is underdeveloped and further insights are needed for practitioners and theresearch community to understand how exercise should be administered, depending on the healthand clinical status of different populations.
This  Special  Issue  focuses  on  the  influence  of  fitness  and  physical  activity  and  the  effects  of
exercise  interventions  on  human  health-  and  disease-related  outcomes.   This  includes,  but  is  notrestricted to, the following article types:
•  Observational studies assessing the association of physical fitness (alone or in combination with
other risks/protective factors) with health- and disease-related outcomes.
•  Observational  studies  assessing  the  association  of  physical  activity  (alone  or  in  combination
with other lifestyle behaviors) with health- and disease-related outcomes.
This includes studies
assessing physical activity through either objective or subjective means
.
•  Experimental  studies  assessing  the  effects  of  exercise  interventions  (alone  or  in  combination
with other interventions) on health- and disease-related outcomes across the lifespan.
•  Systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the above-mentioned topics are also welcome.

Abstract:
Previous research indicates that high intensity training (HIT) is a more effective exercise
modality,  as  opposed  to  moderate  intensity  training  (MIT),  to  improve  disability  and  physical
performance in persons with chronic nonspecific low back pain (CNSLBP). However, it is unclear
how well benefits are maintained after intervention cessation.  This study aimed to evaluate thelong-term effectiveness of HIT on disability, pain intensity, patient-specific functioning, exercisecapacity, and trunk muscle strength, and to compare the long-term effectiveness of HIT with MIT in
persons with CNSLBP. Persons with CNSLBP (
n
= 35) who participated in a randomized controlled
trial comparing effects of an HIT versus MIT intervention (24 sessions/12 weeks) were included forevaluation at baseline (PRE), directly after (POST), and six months after program finalization (FU) ondisability, pain intensity, exercise capacity, patient-specific functioning, and trunk muscle strength. Ageneral linear model was used to evaluate PRE-FU and POST-FU deltas of these outcome measuresin each group (time effects) and differences between HIT and MIT (interaction effects). Ultimately,twenty-nine participants (mean age = 44.1 year) were analysed (HIT:16; MIT:13). Six participants werelost to follow-up. At FU, pain intensity, disability, and patient-specific functioning were maintainedat the level of POST (which was significant from PRE,
p
< 0.05) in both groups. However, HIT led to
a greater conservation of lowered disability and improved exercise capacity when compared withMIT (
p
< 0.05).  HIT leads to a greater maintenance of lowered disability and improved exercise
capacity when compared to MIT six months after cessation of a 12-week supervised exercise therapyintervention, in persons with CNSLBP.Keywords:

1. Introduction
Chronic nonspecific low back pain (CNSLBP) is a common musculoskeletal disorder
affecting many individuals worldwide [
1
]. It is characterized by fluctuating pain and high
levels of functional disability, and consequently has a major impact on activities of dailyliving, work, and social interactions [
2
]. As it is thought to have a multi-factorial origin at
its base [
3
], guidelines for CNSLBP highlight the need for a multimodal therapy design [
4
].
Exercise therapy (ET) is hereby consistently advocated as an important component in man-

agement [
5
,
6
]. However, while it is presented as the best-evidenced approach, treatment
effect sizes in CNSLBP remain only modest [
7
].
In this regard, a novel ET method, i.e., high intensity training (HIT), has recently been
proven to be a feasible and more effective therapy modality than training protocols at
moderate intensity in CNSLBP [
8
,
9
]. It produces notably greater decreases in functional
disability and improves exercise capacity more in the short term [
9
]. Also, different HIT
protocol modalities have been shown to be equally effective to each other in CNSLBP [
10
].
Indeed, HIT might be better adapted on a physiological level to increase the physicalfitness levels in this population [
5
,
11
]. Furthermore, these outcomes are in line with studies
in other musculoskeletal disorders such as spondyloarthritis or chronic neck pain using
various HIT protocols to improve disease specific outcomes such as pain intensity and
physical functioning [
12
,
13
].
However, CNSLBP by nature often fluctuates over longer periods [
14
]. As such, recur-
rences of gradual pain or episodes with increased pain are very common [
15
,
16
]. It is thus
necessary to obtain a better insight into how exercise-induced benefits directly measuredat the cessation of an intervention are retained [
17
]. While minimal to moderate improve-
ments are observed consistently upon completion of various exercise interventions, theseimprovements are typically lost over time [
18
]. Considering this, the ability to maintain the
long-term impact of exercise interventions for CNSLBP remains a challenge [
18
].
The long-term effectiveness of HIT on specific outcomes has been studied in other
musculoskeletal populations,  such as improving walking speed in persons with kneeosteoarthritis and aerobic fitness and functional ability in rheumatoid arthritis [
19
,
20
].
However, currently, no data are available on retention effects of HIT on therapy outcomesin rehabilitation of persons with CNSLBP. Because of the better short-term results by HITon disability and exercise capacity versus MIT, it is expected that HIT leads to a betterretaining of these benefits after cessation of intervention in the long-term, when compared
with MIT.
Therefore, the aim of this study is (1) to evaluate long-term effectiveness of HIT on
disability, pain intensity, patient-specific functioning, exercise capacity, and trunk mus-cle  strength,  and  (2)  to  compare  long-term  effectiveness  of  HIT  with  MIT  in  persons
with CNSLBP.
2. Materials and Methods2.1. Trial Design
This exploratory study is part of a larger trial that evaluated the effects of training
intensity and training mode in CNSLBP rehabilitation through a prospectively registered,five-arm, RCT organized at REVAL (Hasselt University, Diepenbeek, Belgium). The currentarticle evaluates the effectiveness of HIT in comparison to MIT at six months of follow-up.  A comprehensive research design flowchart is displayed in Figure
1
.  This project
was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Jessa Hospital (Hasselt, Belgium) and
registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02911987.2.2. Participants and Recruitment
Participants were recruited through local study advertisements in Limburg (Belgium).
To be eligible, persons had to speak Dutch, be 25–60 years old, and have medically diag-
nosed CNSLBP [
21
,
22
]. Persons were excluded when they had a history of spinal fusion,
had a musculoskeletal disorder aside from CNSLBP that could affect the execution ofthe therapy program, had co-morbidities (e.g., paresis and/or sensory disturbances byneurological causes), were pregnant, had ongoing compensation claims and/or a workdisability >six months, had followed an exercise intervention for low back pain in the
past three months, or were not able to attend regular therapy appointments.  Interested
persons received a patient information letter and were invited for an intake session. During
that session, the information letter was reviewed, study inclusion and exclusion criteria

were evaluated, the informed consent was signed, and a study specific screening form
concerning red flags for low back pain rehabilitation was filled out.Figure 1.
CONSORT flowchart of the research design. Abbreviations: CNSLBP: chronic nonspecific
low back pain; HIT: High intensity training; MIT: moderate intensity training.2.3. Randomization and Blinding
Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group (‘HIT’) performing a
high intensity training program, or a control group (‘MIT’) performing the same training
program at moderate intensity. To ensure concealment of allocation, a research assistant not
involved in the study picked a sealed, opaque envelope containing the allocated group foreach participant. Given the nature of the exercise intervention it was not possible to blindthe participants and physiotherapists for group assignment. To limit the performance biasof the participants, the study was described to the participants as ‘a comparison betweendifferent modes of exercise therapy treatment’.2.4. Interventions
Participants of both groups were enrolled in a 12-week exercise therapy program
consisting of 24 supervised individual therapy sessions (2
×
1.5 h/week).  The training
protocols have been published more extensively previously [
9
].
Experimental group (‘HIT’):
This group performed a protocol consisting of cardiorespi-
ratory training, general resistance training, and core muscle training, all at high intensity
(see also Table
1
).
3

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health

, 10779
Cardiorespiratory training consisted of an interval protocol on a cycle ergometer
containing five high intensity one-minute bouts (110 revolutions per minute (RPM) at 100%of the VO
2
max workload achieved during the maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test,
separated by one minute of active recovery (75 RPM at 50% of the same VO
2
max workload).
High intensity bouts increased every two sessions by 10”. Recovery time between boutsremained  stable.   This  protocol  was  repeated  from  session  13  to  24  with  an  updated
workload, based on the results from a complementary cardiopulmonary exercise test.
General resistance training consisted of three upper and three lower body exercises ex-
ecuted on fitness devices. A one repetition maximum (1 RM) testing [
23
] was performed for
each exercise. One set of a maximum of twelve repetitions was performed at 80% 1 RM foreach exercise. Researchers progressively increased the exercise weight when the participant
was able to perform more than 10 repetitions on two consecutive training sessions.
Core strength training consisted of six static core exercises. Exercises were chosen as a
function of their ability to load the core muscles at an intensity of at least 40–60% of themaximum voluntary contraction [
24
].  Participants performed one set of ten repetitions
of a ten second static hold.  Participants were encouraged to hold the last repetition as
long as possible. Exercises were made more difficult by increasing the static hold time and
progressing to a more demanding posture when they were executed with a stable coreposture for the indicated time by the participant on two consecutive training sessions.
Control group (‘MIT’):
This group performed a protocol consisting of cardiorespiratory
training, general resistance training, and core muscle training, all at moderate intensity
(see also Table
1
).
Cardiorespiratory training consisted of a continuous training protocol on a cycle
ergometer containing 14 min of cycling (90 RPM at 60% VO
2
max workload).  Duration
increased every two sessions with 1 min 40 s up to 22 min 40 s.  This protocol was re-
peated from sessions 13 to 24 with an updated workload, extracted from a complementary
cardiopulmonary exercise test.
General resistance training was identical to the HIT protocol with the exception of the
exercise intensity. One set of 15 repetitions was performed at 60% of 1 RM.
Core training was identical to the HIT protocol with the exception of the exercise
intensity. Participants performed one set of 10 repetitions of a 10 s static hold. Exercises
were made more difficult when they were executed with a stable core posture for the
indicated time by increasing the time of the static hold each six sessions.

The following baseline participant characteristics were collected: gender, age (years),
weight (kg), and height (cm), to calculate BMI, time of onset of CNSLBP (years, months),
fear of movement (Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia), and physical activity (Physical ActivityScale for Individuals with Physical Disabilities) [
25

]. Outcome measures are described
below and were  collected  at baseline  (‘PRE’), at the  end of  the intervention program
(‘POST’), and six months after cessation of the intervention program (‘FU’). At POST,

is expressed in percentage of disability (higher is more) and displays a degree of func-
tional limitation.
Pain intensity—
The Numeric Pain Rating Score (NPRS) evaluates average pain inten-
sity in the previous six-week period by choosing a number of the 0–10 scale (0 means no
pain and 10 means worst pain imaginable) [
28
].
Patient-specific functioning
—The Patient-Specific Functioning Scale (PSFS) evaluates
individual-specific functioning [
29
].  Participants state three to five of the most relevant
activities compromised due to physical disability and rate them on a 0–10 numeric ratingscale (0 means unable to perform and 10 means able to perform at preinjury level).  Anoverall mean percentage is calculated.
Exercise capacity—
A maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test (75 RPM) on an electron-
ically braked cycle ergometer (eBike Basic, General Electric GmbH, Frankfurt am Main,Germany) evaluates exercise capacity through maximal oxygen uptake (VO
2
max) and
maximal workload through cycling time (min.) [
30
]. Participants started at a low work-
load that gradually increased each minute (
♂
:30W+15
W/min,
♀
:20W+10
W/min).
Supplementary, respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and heart rate were determined throughbreath-by-breath gas exchange analysis (MetaMax 3B, Cortex Medical, Leipzig, Germany)and heartrate monitoring (Polar, Kempele, Finland).
Trunk muscle strength—
A maximal isometric muscle strength test of the trunk flexors
and extensors using an isokinetic dynamometer (System 3, Biodex, Enraf-Nonius [
31
])
evaluates peak torque of trunk flexors and extensors during three maximal repetitions ofisometric trunk flexion and trunk extension [
32
]. Peak torque was expressed in Newton
meter (Nm) and normalized to bodyweight (Nm/kg).2.6. Data Analysis
JMP Pro (12.0, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for data analysis. A sample
size calculation was performed to detect differences in the primary outcome measure
(disability measured by the MODI) between the groups at POST in the primary analysis [
9
],
resulting in a total needed amount of
n
=34(
n
= 17 per group).  A post-hoc observed
power analysis was performed to confirm the specific power for each evaluated outcome
measure in the current analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to display baseline groupcharacteristics. Normality and homoscedasticity of each primary outcome were checkedby fitting a general linear model of the PRE-FU and POST-FU deltas and plotting theresiduals to look for equal variance, symmetry, and identify possible outliers. A generallinear model (MANOVA) was used to evaluate the PRE-FU and POST-FU deltas of eachoutcome measure in each group and the differences between the HIT and MIT group
(interaction effect). An alpha level of 0.05 (two-tailed) was used. Percentage improvement
of PRE-FU deltas was calculated to evaluate minimal clinically important differences [
33
].
Regarding the drop-outs, no imputation of data was performed, under the assumptionthat data were missing at random. However, to check for selective drop-out, differencesbetween participants completing the trial and drop-outs were examined (independentt
-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, X
2
tests).
3. Results3.1. Recruitment and Baseline Data
Thirty-eight participants were included in the initial PRE-POST analysis (HIT:
n
= 19,
MIT:
n
= 19). Significantly more women (69%) were included. Mean age was 44.1 years
(SD = 9.8) and mean pain onset was 11.7 years (SD = 7.7). Both study groups had similar
demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcome measures at baseline (
p
> 0.05), except
for trunk extensor strength (higher in the HIT group). Nonetheless, all treatment effects

Intervention and Follow-Up Drop-Outs
During the intervention phase, three drop-outs were noted (HIT:
n
= 1, MIT:
n
= 2.8%
of all participants from PRE to POST). During the six-month follow-up phase, another sixdrop-outs (HIT:
n
= 2, MIT:
n
= 4.17% of all participants from POST to FU) were noted. Of
these, three participants reported practical issues and three participants did not report anyreason for drop-out. No differences in baseline characteristics were found between drop-outs with or without reasons, or drop-outs and other participants. Finally, 29 participants
were included in the FU analysis (corresponding to a 24% drop-out in total). No adverse
events were noted during this study.3.3. Outcomes at the 6-Month Follow-Up Assessment
An overview of the results is presented in Table

.
MODI  outcomes  remained  significantly  lower  compared  to  PRE  in  both  groups
(
−
13.0 points,  62% improvement in HIT;

significant difference was found from POST to FU in either group. A significant differenceof 3.6 points was found in the deltas of PRE to FU between groups.
NPRS  outcomes  remained  significantly  lower  compared  to  PRE  in  both  groups
(

nificant decrease was also found from POST to FU in MIT, but not in HIT. No significantdifference was found in the deltas of PRE to FU between groups.
PSFS outcomes remained significantly higher compared to PRE in both groups (+26%,
+57% improvement in HIT; +36%, +90% improvement in MIT). No significant difference
was found from POST to FU in either group nor in the deltas of PRE to FU between groups.
VO
2
max remained significantly higher compared to PRE in HIT (3.1 mL/kg/min,
10% improvement), but not in MIT (no improvement at FU). No significant difference was
found from POST to FU in either group. A significant difference of 3.2 mL/kg/min wasfound in the deltas of PRE to FU between groups.
Abdominal muscle strength did not improve compared to PRE in both groups (0.05 Nm/kg,
4% improvement in HIT; 0.03 Nm/kg, 2% improvement in MIT). Back muscle strengthremained significantly better compared to PRE in in MIT (0.34 Nm/kg, 13% improve-ment), but not in HIT (0.19 Nm/kg, 6% improvement).  No significant difference wasfound from POST to FU in either group nor in the deltas of PRE to FU between groups inboth outcomes.

4. Discussion
This study was the first to evaluate the long-term effects of HIT in CNSLBP. Results
show that initial positive therapy effects at the finalization of the therapy program wereretained for all outcomes until at least six months later, as no differences could be foundbetween POST and FU results. Furthermore, improvements since baseline on disabilitylevel and exercise capacity remained clinically relevant and remained significantly largerin the HIT than in the MIT group at FU [
27
,
34
]. These results corroborate the effectiveness
of HIT as a working therapeutic modality in the rehabilitation of CNSLBP.
The evaluation of long-term effects of ET studies in CNSLBP has been incorporated in
systematic review analyses [
5
,
7
]. However, there is still a paucity of pooled data due to
heterogeneous ET protocols. Furthermore, FITT-VP principles of exercise prescription (i.e.,frequency, intensity, time, and type—volume and progression [
35
]) are often insufficiently
defined, making it even more difficult to evaluate the impact of these program methodologycharacteristics on therapy success [
5
].  Only three other studies were found with a clear
description of training intensity and a comparison between ET protocols in CNSLBP. Firstly,Michaelson et al.  (2016) depicted no differences between a high and low load training
program at 12 or 24months follow-up [
36
]. However, in this article, the magnitude of the
load was actually based on an analysis of volume rather than intensity. Besides, an indirectestimation of intensity was made, and no clear objective test was performed to show theactual percentage (e.g., 1 RM testing).  Secondly, both Harts et al.  (2004) and Helmhoutet al. (2008) evaluated the difference between a high and low intensity lumbar extensor
program [
37
,
38
]. Neither found differences between exercise intensities in the short nor the
long term. However, these studies reflected on the use of a very specific strength trainingmode focused solely on the rationale of restoring back muscle function.  Also, training
volume was significantly lower, and the high intensity protocols that were used (ranging
from 35% 1 RM to max. 70% 1 RM in the HIT group) did not meet the standards used inthe present analysis (80% 1 RM strength training).
In the current study, significant differences were noted between PRE and FU in both
the experimental HIT and the control MIT group, indicating the effective longevity of ETas a therapy modality.  However, no additional improvements from POST to FU werefound in either group.  This result supports the outcomes of previous research showingthat patients who present with low back pain often improve markedly in the first six weeks
7

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health
2021
,
18
, 10779
of rehabilitation therapy. After that, improvement often slows down [
18
]. This process can
even be magnified after cessation of the therapy program. Low to moderate levels of painand disability are frequently still present at one year after cessation of therapy, especiallyin the cohorts with persistent pain [
39
]. It should be noted that the sample in our study
already showed low pain intensity (HIT: 2.6/10; MIT: 3.5/10) and disability level (HIT:
7.5/100; MIT: 10.6/100) at POST, which would make further significant improvements veryhard to achieve. The only significant difference found from POST to FU was a pain intensitydecrease in MIT (3.5/10 to 2.3/10), but not in HIT (2.6/10 to 2.3/10). Thus, while at firstglance this might look like an important outcome to support the long-term applicationof MIT, this difference was actually due to the faster decrease in HIT already achieved atPOST (i.e., during the therapy phase). As such, HIT seems to be able to lower pain intensitymore quickly. As this was only evaluated with a subjective measure in this study, futureresearch could try to incorporate more objective measures to improve our understandingof pain and pain processing such as pain pressure thresholds through quantitative sensorytesting [
40
,
41
].
As participants did still display residual pain at FU, adaptations to further optimize
the HIT modality should also be investigated.  Following current clinical guidelines [
6
],
the authors believe HIT should be incorporated in a multimodal therapy design, as thismight stimulate the impact on other factors related to CNSLBP [
6
]. As such, HIT can be
coupled with other important therapy modalities such as delivery of (pain) education andevaluation of and adaptation of therapy to individual therapy goals [
42
,
43
]. In addition,
further research towards the predictors for therapy success is needed.4.1. Limitations
Limitations  of  the  initial  RCT  methodology  have  been  discussed  previously  [
9
].
Nonetheless, some limitations specifically related to this follow-up analysis should be
mentioned. Firstly, because the follow-up analysis was a secondary analysis, study groupsample sizes were not initially designed for long-term follow-up. However, even with low
power (as measured in a post-hoc analysis), significant results were found in this study,
supporting its outcomes. Furthermore, the depicted MODI and VO
2
max outcomes were
still in line with the results from the short-term analysis (that were fully powered). As such,
we believe these outcomes to give a fair representation of the expected outcomes in a fully
powered sample. Secondly, a follow-up of only six months was performed, which might
be low for evaluating the effects of an intervention on long term health behavior. Otherresearch has shown that, up to two years, the same outcomes might be expected but later aregression might occur if behaviors are not changed [
44
]. However, as this was the first
study to evaluate HIT at follow-up, we chose a measurement point at which we expectedloss to follow-up would still be manageable (to ensure proper statistical analysis).  It isnot yet clear whether continuing to perform HIT protocols after a rehabilitation programis needed to retain results beyond six months. Thirdly, physical activity might be a con-founder in the maintaining of results during the period between POST and FU. The absenceof any longitudinal data related to physical activity performed by the participants mighttherefore have caused a performance bias when comparing between participants. Indeed,keeping up regular physical activity and adhering to specific exercise programs after therehabilitation phase have been noted to support therapy success and prevent reoccurrenceof chronic low back pain in the long term [
45
,
46
]. Besides, multiple psychosocial factors
such as perceived stress, self-efficacy, and patients’ perceptions about back pain have alsobeen found to predict development and chronification of low back pain [
47
,
48
]. As such,
future research should emphasize more on incorporating these factors and evaluating theirmediating effects. Fourthly, nine participants dropped out during the course of the protocolfrom PRE to FU. Results of these persons might have been less favorable.  However, nosignificant differences in baseline characteristics were found between these drop-outs andthe included patients. Moreover, no claims with regard to a CNSLBP-related cause to abortthe protocol were made by any participant.

4.2. Future Recommendations
To be able to provide guidelines, better insights on the working mechanism of this
therapy modality are needed. It is still unclear whether HIT improves outcomes due to itsincreased physical demands and the accompanied physiological factors such as improvedmuscle characteristics and anti-inflammatory factors, or other non-physiological factorssuch as increased self-efficacy or fear of movement [
49
,
50
].
5. Conclusions
High intensity training is an effective therapy modality to decrease disease-specific
and physical performance related outcomes in the long term in CNSLBP. Moreover, at sixmonths after cessation, HIT shows greater improvements in disability and exercise capacitythan an equal exercise therapy program performed at moderate intensity. Future researchis needed to evaluate the exact working mechanisms of this therapy modality and optimizetherapy protocols.

Abstract:
Physical fitness is an indicator for children’s public health status.  Therefore, the aim of
this study was to examine the construct validity and the criterion-related validity of the German
motor test (GMT) in Egyptian schoolchildren. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a total of931 children aged 6 to 11 years (age: 9.1
±
1.7 years) with 484 (52%) males and 447 (48%) females in
grades one to five in Assiut city. The children’s physical fitness data were collected using GMT. GMTis designed to measure five health-related physical fitness components including speed, strength,coordination, endurance, and flexibility of children aged 6 to 18 years.  The anthropometric data
were collected based on three indicators: body height, body weight, and BMI. A confirmatory factor
analysis was conducted with IBM SPSS AMOS 26.0 using full-information maximum likelihood.
The results indicated an adequate fit (
χ
2
= 112.3, df = 20;
p
< 0.01; CFI = 0.956; RMSEA = 0.07). The
χ
2
-statistic showed significant results, and the values for CFI and RMSEA showed a good fit. All
loadings of the manifest variables on the first-order latent factors as well as loadings of the first-orderlatent factors on the second-order superordinate factor were significant.  The results also showedstrong construct validity in the components of conditioning abilities and moderate construct validityin the components of coordinative abilities. GMT proved to be a valid method and could be widelyused on large-scale studies for health-related fitness monitoring in the Egyptian population.Keywords:

1. Introduction
Physical fitness (PF) is classified as a public health indicator affecting physical, mental,
and psychological aspects [
1
–
5
].  In addition, PF is also suggested to play a vital role in
brain functions and learning performance [
6
–
8
].  Thus, to effectively combat numerous
public health problems, especially childhood obesity, there is a critical need for increasing
PF levels among children [
9
]. In this context, PF should be ideally promoted at a young age
in order to avoid long-lasting health problems and possibly improve cognitive functionsand mental health [
10
].
A low level of PF and insufficient physical activity are associated with greater somatic
and psychological problems [
1
,
2
]. Therefore, increased levels of PF, specifically muscular
strength, could have significant benefits for the psychological health of overweight/obesechildren [
11
]. In addition, high PF levels are associated with less unfavorable body com-
position among children with elevated school stress [
12
]. Moreover, PF is also related to
social health, such that the school environment is more conducive to the development ofPF for promoting the students’ social health [
5
].
Indeed, PF is usually determined in school-aged children using health-related PF
batteries (e.g., field tests) [
13
]. Therefore, having good criteria for collecting PF data among
children and youths is useful for identifying problems or optimizing performances inorder to provide intervention programs that develop children’s status [
14
–
16
]. Indeed, the
assessment of PF became a necessary topic in epidemiological studies, since a reduction in

PF is directly associated with the incidence of obesity, coronary heart diseases, diabetes,and hypertension in adults [
17
–
19
].
Motor Performance Abilities (MPA)
There is a large body of historical work on the differentiation of motor abilities [
20
–
27
].
All approaches are based on the idea that the motor system is a complex, multidimensional
construct that cannot be adequately described by one single characteristic. Differentiationsof motor abilities are mostly based on the assumption of so-called basic qualities [
28
]orma-
jor forms of physical performance [
29
] and allow for a sufficiently accurate initial diagnosis
and orientation for controlling the exercise load in physical education in the basic trainingof competitive sports but also in health and rehabilitation sports. However, differentiationsaccording to ability categories are not sufficiently precise for performance explanations and
prognoses, for training control at a high performance level, for sport-specific description
models, or for disease-specific questions in rehabilitation. Here, diagnoses require a more
process- and function-oriented approach with the help of sports-medicine or biomechanical
measurement methods.
According to Bös and Mechling [
30
], MPA is on a first level differentiated according to
the poles of energy and information into physical (energetic) and coordinative (information-oriented) abilities. On a second level, there is a breakdown into the much-cited “basic motor
qualities” of endurance, strength, speed, coordination, and flexibility. The assignment of
endurance and strength abilities to the energetically determined functional processes resultsfrom the distinction between the cardiovascular system and the skeletal muscles as centralsystems of energy production and energy transport in the human organism. The extent,the mass, and the structure of skeletal muscle are considered prerequisites for strength
performance. The performance of the cardiovascular system represents determining and
limiting variables for endurance performance.
In this context, the German motor test (GMT) [
31
] was developed as an objective tool
to measure a complete fitness profile involving speed, endurance, strength, coordinationunder precision demands, coordination under time pressure, and flexibility [
32
,
33
]. The test
battery was designed to be easily used in sports gym for physical examination. The content-
related validity of all test items was consistently rated as good in terms of significance andfeasibility based on expert ratings.
In Egypt, the health-related fitness components of schoolchildren were not sufficiently
studied in recent decades, which negatively affects any intervention strategies, plans, or
programs.  Currently, it is useful for educational settings, parents, clinicians, and sports
organizations to have valid and reliable health-related fitness data about children. In thiscontext, this test could be used in Egypt as a data-collection tool for identifying problems orexcellent performance in the field of public health, talent identification, exercise pediatric,and epidemiological studies [
9
,
11
,
14
–
16
].
Indeed, providing a valid and reliable tool for measuring health-related fitness com-
ponents is very helpful for long-term and sustainable development of sport and health
ecosystems in Egypt. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the construct validityand the criterion-related validity of the German motor test in Egyptian children aged 6 to
11 years.
2. Materials and Methods2.1. Study Design and Sampling
A cross-sectional study was conducted between 2014 and 2017 at 13 public primary
schools in the city of Assiut, which is the largest town in upper Egypt and is locatedabout 234 miles south of Cairo. The size of the primary-school student population aged6 to 11 years in Assiut is about 76,334 students. The total number of public schools is 69,distributed in 7 districts. The final sample was randomly selected from the chosen schoolsand consisted of 931 children aged 6 to 11 years (age: 9.1
±
1.7 years) with 484 (52%) males
and 447 (48%) females in grades 1 to 5 of primary schools in Assiut.

Precisely, the test development was based on an international expert survey involving
40 selected fitness experts in 25 European countries who were asked about the relevance ofthe test contents and requirements in sport-motor tests with respect to MPA documenta-tion [
34
].  Subsequently, 13 experts evaluated the significance and the practicality of the
study exercises on a scale of 1 (very good) to 5 (very bad). The evaluations in both regions
were found to be within a good range (M
Significance
= 1.9; M
Practicality
= 1.7). To determine
test–retest reliability, the motor tests were performed twice within 4 days on the samechildren using the same test situation and the same study investigator.  All in all, there
were good test–retest reliability coefficients (R
min
= 0.74 to R
max
= 0.96).
2.2. Data Collection2.2.1. Anthropometric Characteristics Data
Assessment of the anthropometric characteristics of the children was based on three
indicators: body height, body weight, and BMI. The instruments were calibrated accord-ing to the standard preparation prior to measurement.  Measurements were taken withschoolchildren wearing light clothing and no shoes. Body weight was measured with abeam balance to the nearest 0.1 kg. Body height was measured with a stadiometer to thenearest 0.5 cm. BMI was defined as the ratio of body weight to body height squared, ex-
pressed in kg/m. Subjects were classified as underweight, normal weight, and overweight
(i.e., overweight and obese) according to the published standards by the International
Obesity Task Force based on age and sex difference characteristics [
35
].
2.2.2. Physical Fitness Data
The German motor test (GMT) was used to measure five health related-physical fitness
components of children aged 6 to 18 years [
36
]. To determine test–retest reliability in the
Egyptian sample, the test was performed twice within 7 days with the same childrenusing the same test situation and the same study investigator. Good test–retest reliabilitycoefficients were obtained (R-values between 0.68 and 0.94). The test items were describedand performed according to Lämmle et al. [
37
] and Abdelkarim et al. [
38
] as the following:
Speed: The 20 m sprint test is used to measure speed ability. The child must cover a
distance of 20 m in as short a time as possible in two trials; the best trial is evaluated. Thetime required for the sprint is measured to the nearest tenth of a second using a stopwatch
(the start is from a standing position).
Coordination:  Balancing backwards (BB) is used to measure coordination under
precision demands. The child must walk backwards over three beams of approximately
the same length (300 cm) but different widths (6 cm, 4.5 cm, and 3 cm) in two valid trials
while maintaining balance. The goal is to stay on each of the beams, i.e., not miss, during
the course of two valid trials. A total of six successful trials are evaluated. The number ofsteps taken while walking backwards is counted. The variable used for the analysis is thesum of the steps taken during all six trials while walking backwards.  Side jumping (JS)is used to measure whole-body coordination under time pressure, speed, and muscularendurance of the lower extremities. The child must jump sideways across the center lineof the carpet mat with both legs at the same time as fast as possible without exceedingthe given field size (50–100 cm). Two trials of 15 s each are performed. The recovery timebetween the trials is 1 min. The number of jumps made during the two trials is evaluated,and the average of the two trials is analyzed.
Strength:  Push-ups (PU) and sit-ups (SU) are used to measure dynamic muscular
endurance of the upper extremities and the abdominal muscles, respectively.  The childis asked to perform as many push-ups or sit-ups as possible in two trials of 40 s each.
The starting position of the push-ups is the lying position with hands clasped behind the
back. The second position is the raised position of the standard push-up (i.e., with armsextended). In the third position, one hand touches the top of the hand of the supportingarm before returning to the starting position.  The average of the two attempts is used.
The standing long jump (SLJ) test is used to measure the jumping strength and the spring

strength of the leg muscles.  The test person jumps with both legs and tries to reach thegreatest possible distance. The propulsion may only be increased by swinging the arms,but it is not allowed to reach back with one or both hands. The distance (in cm) from thestarting line to the heel of the foot behind when landing is measured.  The best of twojumps is used for analysis.
Endurance: A six-minute running test is used to measure aerobic endurance. The child
is asked to run around a volleyball court as many times as possible within six minutes. Themeasurement for each child is the distance in meters covered within six minutes. The lengthof the path is the number of laps (1 lap = 54 m) plus the distance covered in the last lap.
Flexibility: The stand-and-reach (SR) test is used to measure trunk flexibility and the
elasticity of back and leg muscles.  The test person stands on a wooden box and slowlybends forward at the waist. The arms and the hands must reach down as far as possible
with the legs extended. The better of two trials is noted in centimeters.
2.3. Statistical Analysis
A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted with IBM SPSS AMOS 26. (IBM Corp.:
Armonk, NY, USA) [
39
] using full-information maximum likelihood, which has the advan-
tage that, when models with missing values are computed, the estimates are less biasedthan when classical methods such as listwise deletion, pairwise deletion, or mean impu-tation are used to handle missing values [
40
]. A five-factor structure with a global factor
of physical fitness was assessed. The assessment of global goodness-of-fit was based onseveral fit indices. First, a non-significant p-value in the
χ
2
-statistic indicates a good model
fit [
41
]. However, this test depends on the sample size, and even minor differences between
the implied model and the observed covariance matrix led to significant results [
42
].
Second, the comparative fit index (CFI) shows the relative fit improvement by com-
paring the proposed model with the baseline model. Cut-off values for CFI are desirable
above 0.95 and adequate above 0.90 [
43
]. Third, the root mean square error of approxima-
tion (RMSEA) describes the error of approximation in the population. RMSEA values areadequate below 0.08 and desirable below 0.05 [
44
]. To examine criterion-related validity,
the relationship between physical fitness and children’s BMI was assessed using bivariatecorrelations. For that purpose, a dummy variable was created to compare children who areclassified as overweight or obese with those not classified as such [
35
]. Separate models
were estimated for each calculation of bivariate correlations between the dummy variable
and the latent variables.3. Results3.1. Descriptive Statistics

contains raw score means, standard deviations, and correlations between all
test indicators.  The correlation coefficient between test items was easily demonstrated.
The highest correlation coefficient values were shown between the 20 m sprint test and
the long jump test (R =
−
0.67). On the other hand, the lowest correlation coefficient was
demonstrated between the 6 min run and flexibility (R = 0.08), which is classified as a
passive system of energy transfer. However, significant correlations between the 6 min run
test and the test items related to strength ability were shown (R
pushup
= 0.30, R
situp
= 0.42,
and R
longjump
= 0.46). There was also a strong correlation between the test item for the 20 m
sprint and the test items for push-ups (R = 0.39), sit-ups in 40 s (R = 0.50), and the longjump (R =
−
0.67), respectively.  The test items measuring coordination ability (jumping
sideways, balancing backwards) showed a moderate significant correlation with the testitems measuring sprint and strength ability. High correlations were shown between thejumping sideways test item and the 20 m sprint (R =
−
0.51), the long jump (R = 0.47), the
push-ups (R = 0.43), and the sit-ups in 40 s (R = 0.40).

Bös and Mechling’s model [
30
] was presented in (Figure
1
) as a structural equation
model. The dimensions of endurance, coordination under time pressure, coordination with
precision demands, and flexibility were operationalized with one item each. The strength
dimension included four indicators. The superordinate dimension was motor performanceability (see Figure
2
). The results of the model indicated an adequate fit (
χ
2
= 112.3,
df=20
,
p
< 0.01; CFI = 0.956; RMSEA = 0.07). Although the
χ
2
-statistic showed significant results,
the values of CFI and RMSEA showed a good fit. All loadings of the manifest variableson the first-order latent factors and the loadings of the first-order latent factors on thesecond-order superordinate factor were significant.Figure 1.

Regarding BMI, we used a variable comparing children classified as overweight or
obese with those not classified as such.  This variable correlated significantly with en-
durance (R =
−
0.22, Z =
−
4.58,
p
< 0.01), coordination with precision demands (
R=
−
0.40
,
Z=

,
p
< 0.01), and overall motor performance ability (R =
−
0.16, Z =
−
4.66,
p
< 0.01)
but not with flexibility (R = 0.04, Z = 0.34,
p
= 0.73) or strength (R =
−
0.04, Z =
−
1.51,
p
= 0.13
). Interestingly, contrary to our expectations, the results showed that time pressure
was positively correlated with BMI (R = 0.17
, Z = 4.19,
p
< 0.01).
4. Discussion
Construct validity and criterion-related validity of the German motor test (GMT)
were studied in Egyptian schoolchildren. The results of the confirmatory factorial analysis
showed a good fit of Bös and Mechling’s model [
30
] for the structure of motor performance
abilities with good values for CFI and RMSEA. The criterion validity coefficient was ac-ceptable for the majority of the test items. GMT showed strong construct validity in thecomponents of energetically determined (conditioning) abilities including cardiorespiratorycapacity (endurance), muscle strength, and speed. However, the test showed moderate con-struct validity in the components of information-oriented (coordinative) abilities includingcoordination with precision demands and coordination under time pressure.
The results showed a good construct validity with high significant values for the
loading of the test items. The second-order factor was based on the five first-order factorsof endurance, strength, coordination under time pressure, coordination with precisiondemands, and flexibility. The results suggested comparable results to other studies usingthe same test battery [
36
,
45
].   In addition,  the current results confirmed the previous
results of another test battery consisting of a combination of speed, endurance, strength,coordination, and flexibility that were shown to be valid, functional, and easy to administerfor measuring children’s physical fitness in different European populations in the sameage groups [
16
,
46
].
The results also showed high loadings for the test items for strength, coordination
with precision demands, and coordination under time pressure. These high loadings point
to the potential of these test items as indicators of performance level [
37
]. In contrast, the
loading of flexibility showed the lowest loading value. This confirmed the assumption thatflexibility is a rather independent dimension (passive system of energy transfer). Moreover,
18

, 8341
flexibility shows a general deterioration in performance with age growing in both genders,especially in girls [
47
].
Indeed, the validity of the German motor test (GMT) in Egyptian children confirms
the importance of measuring the levels of PF based on quantitative measurements suchas anthropometric data and health-related fitness batteries [
48
,
49
].  These types of mea-
surements are more practical, motivating, and provide an accurate overview of fitnesslevels, especially in the child population.  In addition, the association between physical
fitness and body mass index was shown to provide an indication of test validity, especiallyin prepubertal school children [
38
,
50
]. However, greater effort and logistical support are
needed for data collection in large-scale studies [
17
,
51
,
52
].
This study provides an economical and objective data collection tool to increase the
possibility of national representative studies for health-related physical fitness in Egypt. The
tests included in the tool can help to provide an overview about Egyptian children’s rate ofinvolvement in physical activity. PF provides objective data which could predict the rate of
participation in physical activity. Guthold et al. [
53
] point out that nationally representative
data for physical activity using scientific measurements, such as accelerometers, are onlyavailable for high-income countries.  Low-income countries, mainly in the Middle Eastand North Africa, had a very low proportion of available data with the estimated overall
percentage of insufficient physical activity reaching 32%. Here, the WHO recommendation
on physical activity and sedentary behavior should be strongly considered to achievebenefits in children and adolescents for improved physical fitness (cardiorespiratory andmuscular fitness), cardiometabolic health (blood pressure, glucose, and insulin resistance),bone health, cognitive outcomes (academic performance, executive function), mental health
(reduced symptoms of depression), and reduced obesity [
54
].
5. Conclusions
The German motor test (GMT) was shown to be a valid method for measuring PF in
children in Egypt. This valid tool for data collection opens a large window for researchersto use in large-scale studies monitoring health-related fitness components in the fieldsof epidemiology, talent identification, and health-related educational studies. However,larger and representative samples are needed to establish reference standards in Egyptianchildren to correctly interpret the results of such tests by generating sex- and age-specificnormative percentile values to be available for comparative studies and to establish anational database and fitness profile for the Egyptian population.

Abstract:
This study aimed to examine the association of relative handgrip strength (rHGS) with
cardiometabolic disease risk factors in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods:Seventy-seven women with SLE (mean age 43.2, SD 13.8) and clinical stability during the previoussix months were included. Handgrip strength was assessed with a digital dynamometer and rHGS
was defined as absolute handgrip strength (aHGS) divided by body mass index (BMI). We measured
blood pressure, markers of lipid and glucose metabolism, inflammation (high sensitivity C-reactive
protein [hs-CRP]), arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity [PWV]), and renal function.  A clustered
cardiometabolic risk index (z-score) was computed. Results: Pearson

s bivariate correlations revealed
that higher rHGS was associated with lower systolic blood pressure (SBP), triglycerides, hs-CRP, PWV,
and lower clustered cardiometabolic risk (r

< 0.05). Multivariable
linear regression analyses adjusted for age, disease activity (SLEDAI), and accrual damage (SDI)confirmed these results (all
p
< 0.05) except for triglycerides. Conclusions: The findings suggest that
higher rHGS is significantly associated with lower cardiometabolic risk in women with SLE.Keywords:

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease marked with
a  wide  variety  of  organ  system  dysfunctions,  such  as  damage  to  joints,  lungs,  heart,kidneys,  brain,  blood  vessels  or  skin  [
1
,
2
].   The  SLE  prevalence  rates  are  20  of  every
100,000 women [
3
], and it affects women at a rate of 10:1 more than men [
4
].  Due to
improved diagnostic methods and treatments [
5
], mortality in SLE patients continues
to improve. However, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases are still one of the biggest
causes of mortality in SLE [
6
], and common risk factors cannot fully explain the increased
cardiometabolic risk in this population [
7
].
Traditional cardiometabolic risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, dyslipi-
demia,  and  smoking  [
8
,
9
],  and  non-traditional  cardiometabolic  risk  factors  including
abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, lipid profile, arterial stiffness, renal markers, andhigh-sensitivity  C-reactive  protein  (hs-CRP;  as  a  marker  of  inflammation  [
10
,
11
])  lev-
els [
8
,
12
,
13
] are both expensive and difficult to measure outside a clinical environment [
14
].

Furthermore, patients with SLE are usually treated with corticosteroids, which at highdoses interfere with lipid and glycemic metabolism [
15
].
Muscular strength is reduced in women with SLE [
16
,
17
], and low strength levels
are associated with higher fatigue, worse quality of life [
18
], and higher risk of cardio-
vascular disease and mortality [
19
,
20
].  Handgrip strength, a simple and quick method
to assess upper body muscular strength, is inversely associated with coronary heart dis-
ease [
19
,
21
], inflammation (which appears very often in SLE) [
22
], and mortality risk [
23
]
in the general population. In women with SLE, handgrip strength is negatively related toobesity [
13
,
17
,
19
], and positively associated with quality of life [
24
].
Relative handgrip strength (rHGS), defined by the summation of both hands’ strength
divided by body mass index (BMI), is an easy instrument for measuring relative mus-cular strength in clinical practice and public health [
25
] and has been recommended in
recent research to address the increased strength due to body mass [
25
–
28
].  Handgrip
strength and BMI have both been linked to cardiometabolic disease risk in the general
population [
29
–
32
],
although the evidence regarding the association of rHGS with car-
diometabolic risk in women is scarce [
26
].  Since rHGS is cost- and time-efficient, it is
of clinical interest to understand the extent to which it  might be associated with car-
diometabolic risk factors in a population at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases, such as
women with SLE.
The primary purpose of the current study was to examine the association of rHGS
with biomarkers of cardiometabolic disease risk in women with SLE.
2. Materials and Methods2.1. Design and Participants
In this cross-sectional study, a total of 172 Caucasian patients with SLE were invited
to participate.  Inclusion criteria were:  (i) women aged between 18 and 60 years with
(ii) >4 SLE classification criteria provided by the American College of Rheumatology [
33
];
(iii) a minimum follow-up of one year at our unit; and (iv) clinical stability (i.e., the absence
of changes in the systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI) and/ortreatment) during the previous 6 months.  Exclusion criteria were:  (i) not being able toread, understand, and/or sign the informed consent; (ii) having cancer; (iii) history ofclinical cardiovascular disease and/or lung disease in the last year; and (iv) receivingdoses of biological treatment higher than 10 mg/d of prednisone (or equivalent) in the
previous 6 months. All participants received detailed information about the study aims
and procedures and signed informed consent before being included in the study.2.2. Measurement of Relative Handgrip Strength
Muscular strength was assessed through the handgrip strength test.  The handgrip
strength test [
34
] was assessed using a digital dynamometer (Model T.K.K.540
®
; Takei
Scientific Instruments Co., Ltd., Niigata, Japan) with a precision to the nearest 0.1 kg.
Participants performed the trial in a standing position, with the elbow fully extended andthe arm relaxed in a neutral position and were encouraged by the evaluators to exert to theirmaximal effort during a couple of seconds, alternating between the two hands. Participants
performed the test twice with a one-minute break between the two attempts of each hand.
The aHGS was summed from the best score of each hand. The rHGS was defined as aHGS
divided by BMI [
25
]. Height (cm) was measured using a stadiometer (SECA 222, Hamburg,
Germany) and weight (kg) with a bioimpedance device (InBody R20, Biospace, Seoul,Korea). BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m
2
).
2.3. Measurement of Cardiometabolic Risk Factors
Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and resting heart rate
were measured using the Mobil-O-Graph
®
24 h pulse wave analysis monitor (IEM GmbH,
Stolberg, Germany) in a sitting position according to the European Society of Hyperten-sion [
35
], after 5 min of rest.

Arterial stiffness was indirectly assessed through the pulse wave velocity (PWV) [
36
].
The test was performed in a sitting position after 5 min of rest, using the Mobil-O-Graph
®
24 h pulse wave analysis monitor, the operation of which is based on oscillometry recordedby a blood pressure cuff placed on the brachial artery.  This instrument is validated forclinical practice [
36
].  PWV was obtained from a single measurement.  The coefficient
of variation (CV) of the Mobil-O-Graph for consecutive PWV analyses is 3.4%, and its
intraclass correlation coefficient is 0.98 (0.96–0.99) [
37
].
Venous fasting blood samples were collected in the morning with heparin as the anti-
coagulant. Blood was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 15 min to separate the plasma, which wassubsequently removed. Plasma triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c),low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), total cholesterol, glucose, urea, albumin andcreatinine concentrations were analyzed enzymatically with an autoanalyzer (OlympusDiagnostic, Hamburg, Germany). Insulin was measured with an enzyme immunoassaykit, and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calcu-lated [(fasting insulin (
μ
IU/mL)
×
fasting glucose (mg/dL))/405].  Apolipoproteins A
and B, hs-CRP, and glycosylated hemoglobin were determined by immunoturbidimetry
(HORIBA-ABX Diagnostics, Japan) with an autoanalyzer (PENTRA-400, HORIBA-ABX
Diagnostics, Japan). The albumin-creatinine ratio was measured from a first-morning urinesample. Values above or equal to 30 mg/g in women were considered pathological. Theestimated glomerular filtration rate was determined by the modification of diet in renaldisease (MDRD) equation [

2.4. Other Measurements
All participants filled out a sociodemographic and clinical data questionnaire to gather
information, such as age, disease duration, current medication (including antidiabeticsand corticosteroids), and tobacco consumption. The systemic lupus erythematosus diseaseactivity  index  (SLEDAI)  was  included  to  assess  disease  activity  [
39
],  considering  the
presence or absence of several clinical and analytical manifestations in the preceding
10 days.
The final score ranges from 0 to 105, where a higher score indicates a higher degree
of disease activity. The degree of tissue damage from the onset of the disease was evaluated
by the International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology’s systemiclupus damage index (SLICC-SDI) [
40
]. The score ranges from 0 to 40, where a higher score
indicates greater damage produced by SLE in the last 6 months.2.5. Sample Size
The sample size was calculated for a clinical trial evaluating the effects of aerobic
exercise on arterial stiffness, inflammation, and fitness, which was published earlier [
41
].
We recruited 58 participants for that trial, although a larger sample (
n=
77) was used to
perform baseline evaluations for cross-sectional analyses.
2.6. Statistical Analysis
The descriptive characteristics of the study participants are presented as means and
standard deviations for continuous variables, and as frequencies and percentages for cat-egorical variables, unless otherwise indicated in Table
1
. Due to the presence of outliers,
hs-CRP was winsorized. Normality was assessed through histograms, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov Test, and Q–Q plots, with muscular strength and cardiometabolic risk factorsshowing a normal distribution.   Pearson’s bivariate correlations were used to explorethe raw association between rHGS and cardiometabolic risk factors, and we additionallyassessed the crude association of aHGS and BMI with cardiometabolic risk factors. Regres-sion models were built including each cardiometabolic risk factor as dependent variablesin separate models. rHGS, age, SLEDAI, and SDI were entered as independent variables

in all models (enter method). Age, SLEDAI, and SDI were entered as covariables due totheir potential role as confounders [
42
]. Menopause, statins or corticosteroids were initially
included, but they did not alter the coefficients, and thus they were not included in finalmodels to avoid overfitting [
43
].

A clustered cardiometabolic risk index (z-score) [
12
] was created using the mean
of the standardized scores [(value-mean)/standard deviation] for SBP, fasting glucose,
triglycerides, HOMA-IR, total cholesterol/HDL-c, and hs-CRP. Statistical significance wasset at
p
< 0.05.
3. Results
The flowchart of the study participants is presented in Figure
1
.   From a total of
172 patients initially invited, 81 refused to participate (41 patients reported living very far
from the hospital, 36 were not able to find time to perform the evaluations, and 4 were notinterested), 12 patients did not present clinical stability during the previous 6 months tothe beginning of the study, and 2 patients had cardiovascular disease during the previous
year. A total of 77 women with SLE (mean age 43.2, SD 13.8) complied with the inclusion
criteria, agreed to participate, and were assessed in two waves (49 women in October 2016and 28 women in February 2017). Both evaluations were identical. Two women did not
perform the handgrip strength test due to a wrist injury.

4. Discussion
The main finding of this study is that a higher rHGS was associated with lower
SBP, triglycerides, hs-CRP, PWV, and clustered cardiometabolic risk index (z-score) in
women with SLE. Furthermore, rHGS could be an alternative to aHGS when evaluating
cardiometabolic risk. Our results were consistent despite adjusting for multiple potentialconfounders such as age, SLEDAI, SDI, statins, menopause, smoking or corticosteroids.

The association of aHGS and cardiometabolic risk has been previously studied in the
general population. Lee et al. [
27
] found that a higher aHGS was associated with lower car-
diovascular risk in older Korean adults. Similar findings were described by
Leong et al. [
21
],
who found that aHGS was inversely associated with all-cause death in a prospective co-
hort study with 140,000 men and women.   However,
Gregorio-Arenas et al. [
44
]
found
no association of aHGS with cardiometabolic risk in a sample of 228 perimenopausal
women. In line with this, Gubelmann, Vollenweider and Marques-Vidal [
45
] observed no
association between aHGS and cardiovascular risk in healthy adults.  Regarding rHGS,
previous studies have assessed its association with cardiometabolic risk, although not in
rheumatological or autoimmune populations. Choquette et al. found that rHGS could bean indicator of cardiometabolic risk in 1793 community-dwelling men and women [
25
].
Moreover,
Lawman et al. [
28
]
found that higher rHGS was significantly associated with
lower SBP, triglycerides, glucose, and higher HDL in both healthy men and women. Finally,Campa et al. [
46
] demonstrated that resistance training is effective in improving both
cardiometabolic risk factors and rHGS in obese women, but improvements regarding rHGSare only achieved if training frequency is high and prolonged over time [
47
]. Our results
are overall in line with these findings derived from other populations and extend currentknowledge on potential indicators of cardiometabolic risk in SLE, as well as agreeing withrecent literature.
The novel approach of this study is the concurrent analysis of the association of rHGS,
aHGS and BMI itself with cardiometabolic risk factors.  Although no statistical test cancompare the strength of their independent association with the outcomes, these analyses
provide the opportunity to determine which of these markers of risk is more worthwhile in
clinical practice. Overall, rHGS and BMI were clearly better indicators of cardiometabolicrisk than aHGS. However, when comparing BMI with rHGS, the results were less clear.
While BMI was associated with markers of insulin resistance and the association with the
clustered cardiometabolic risk score was stronger than with rHGS, rHGS was more stronglyassociated with arterial stiffness and, more importantly, with hs-CRP. As inflammationis a hallmark of autoimmune diseases including SLE, these results should not be takeninto consideration when deciding whether to include the assessment of handgrip strengthin clinical practice.  The relatively low sample size precludes making strong argumentseither in favor of or against this, although further research on this topic seems warranted.In practical terms, it is obvious that BMI is the simplest way to obtain a strong marker ofcardiometabolic risk.  However, it must be considered that adding a handgrip strengthassessment takes approximately 2 min (including double assessment of both hands), which,depending on the context, might be feasible or not.
This study has potential limitations. Although other widely used tools to measure CV
risk have been proposed, these tools could underestimate CV risk in patients with SLE. Ourstudy provides a greater knowledge of CV risk using individual factors and a cluster score.
The cross-sectional design precludes the establishment of causal relationships; therefore,
our results must be corroborated in future prospective and experimental research.  Thesample size was relatively small, and we do not know whether these results apply to menor to women with medium or high disease activity, as only women with mild diseaseactivity were included.5. Conclusions
The  findings  suggest  that  higher  rHGS  is  significantly  associated  with  lower  car-
diometabolic risk in women with SLE. Although assessing rHGS might add relevant informa-tion regarding the potential cardiometabolic risk of SLE patients, BMI alone is a rather goodindicator of cardiometabolic risk that might be preferred under
time-constrained situations.

Abstract:
Obesity and cardiorespiratory fitness exhibit negative and positive impacts, respectively,
on executive function. Nevertheless, the combined effects of these two factors on executive functionremain unclear. This study investigated the combined effects of obesity and cardiorespiratory fitnesson response inhibition of executive function from both behavioral and neuroelectric perspectives.Ninety-six young adults aged between 18 and 25 years were recruited and assigned into four groups:the high cardiorespiratory fitness with normal weight (NH), high cardiorespiratory fitness withobesity (OH), low cardiorespiratory fitness with normal weight (NL), and low cardiorespiratoryfitness with obesity (OL) groups. The stop-signal task and its induced P3 component of event-related
potentials was utilized to index response inhibition. The participants with higher cardiorespiratory
fitness (i.e.,  the NH and OH groups) demonstrated better behavioral performance (i.e.,  shorterresponse times and higher accuracy levels), as well as shorter stop-signal response times and largerP3 amplitudes than their counterparts with low cardiorespiratory fitness (i.e., the NL and OL groups).
The study provides first-hand evidence of the substantial effects of cardiorespiratory fitness on the
response inhibition, including evidence that the detrimental effects of obesity might be overcome byhigh cardiorespiratory fitness.Keywords:

1. Introduction
The obesity epidemic is increasingly regarded as a global pandemic, as more than
13% of people aged 18 years and over were of excessive weight in 2016 [
1
]. Obesity is not
only linked to a broad range of long-term medical complications, such as cardiovasculardisease, type II diabetes, and several types of cancers [
2
], but is also considered to be a
risk factor for healthy lifestyle habits [
3
] and psychiatric conditions [
4
], such that it has
profound economic consequences.
Obesity also has negative effects on various aspects of executive function (EF) [
5
],
such as inhibition. Inhibition refers to the ability to override a planned, prepotent responseor to stop already initiated responses (i.e., response inhibition) [
6
]. Several studies have
utilized a highly theoretically driven cognitive task, the stop-signal task (SST) [
7
], to assess
the efficiency of response inhibition. During the SST, the person being tested is requiredto response quickly to the go stimuli.  Occupationally, the person needs to launch the

stop-process induced by the stop stimuli to inhibit the go-process induced by the gostimuli, with that stoppage involving the top-down initiation of the aphasic inhibitory
process [
7
]. Notably, the excessive weight has been attributed to failures to inhibit impulsive
or prepotent responses [
8
]. For instance, individuals with higher BMI scores required longer
duration of the reaction time to stop the ongoing response (i.e., stop-signal response time,or SSRT) compared to individuals with normal BMI scores [
9
].  Similarly, obese young
adults have been reported to exhibit greater difficulties in response inhibition, as reflectedby having longer SSRTs than normal-weight individuals [
10
], suggesting a relationship
between less efficient response inhibition and obesity in the adult population.
Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) may also affect various aspects of EF [
11
,
12
]. Cross-
sectional research has revealed a positive relationship between CRF and the performanceof the tasks involving interference aspect of inhibition in late-middle-aged [
13
] and older
adults [
14
].  Similarly, studies using laboratory-based and filed-based CRF assessments
have indicated positive associations between CRF and task performance involving responseinhibition in preadolescent children [
15
] and young adults [
16
,
17
]. Finally, similar positive
links between CRF and working memory [
11
,
18
] and shifting [
18
,
19
] aspects of EF have
been reported.
The potential effect of CRF on the association between obesity and EF has been further
suggested by the ”fat-but-fit” paradigm.  Specifically, the fat-but-fit paradigm suggeststhat higher levels of physical activity or CRF might alleviate some of the adverse effectsof obesity (i.e., its effect on all-cause mortality) [
20
,
21
]. The fat-but-fit paradigm has been
extended to attenuation of the adverse effects of obesity on cognitive function. For instance,Song, et al. [
22
] compared the performance of interference aspect of inhibition in relation to
levels of CRF and BMI, and reported no significant differences in behavioral performanceamong young adults with high CRF, regardless of their weight status, on the neutral condi-tion of the Stroop task, suggesting that CRF might alleviate the adverse effects of obesity onbasic information processing. In another study, Ross, et al. [

] measured CRF, % of body
fat, waist-height ratio, and cognitive function in adolescents, and found that the associationbetween obesity and visual working memory was partially mediated by CRF. These studieshave explored the interrelationships between CRF, obesity, and various aspects of EF (i.e.,the interference aspect of inhibition and working memory), and have provided initialevidence supporting the conclusion that CRF might act to modulate, attenuate, or possiblyoffset the detrimental effects of obesity in some aspects of EF. Nevertheless, to the bestof our knowledge, no research has investigated the interrelationship between CRF andobesity, in terms of their combined effects on response inhibition.
Event-related potential (ERP), a noninvasive measure of brain electrical activity, may
provide more insights regarding how response inhibition is associated with CRF and obesity.
ERPs represent time-locked neuroelectric activities with sensitive temporal resolution,
providing the opportunity for direct and detailed examinations of the neural mechanisms
of mental processes [
24
]. In previous studies, individuals with higher CRF demonstrated
larger P3 amplitudes along with shorter response times (RTs) and/or higher responseaccuracy levels [
22
,
25
,
26
].   Given that the P3 amplitude is regarded as a reflection of
the amount of attentional resources allocated [
27
], such results suggest that higher CRF
levels might support the recruitment of attentional resources and contribute to superiorbehavioral performance.  Meanwhile, decreased P3 amplitudes and impaired response
inhibition have been reported during the auditory discrimination task paradigm [
28
] and
the Go/NoGo task [
29
] in obese and/or overweight children.
Taken together, the above findings indicate that obesity and CRF are negatively and
positively associated with inhibition, respectively. Nevertheless, the combined effects of
CRF and excessive weight on response inhibition remain unknown. The present study wasthus conducted to investigate how CRF and excessive weight are simultaneously associated
with response inhibition, as assessed by the SST, from both behavioral and neuroelectric
perspectives. Given the negative impacts of obesity and the positive effects of CRF reportedpreviously, it was hypothesized that individuals with high CRF and normal weight would
36

, 3429
exhibit superior response inhibition-related performance and that obese individuals withlow CRF would exhibit worse response inhibition-related performance, both in terms ofbehavioral and neuroelectric measures.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Participants
Healthy males aged 18 to 25 years who met the following criteria were recruited:
(a) normal or corrected-to-normal vision; (b) no color blindness; (c) no history of neurologi-
cal disorders, psychiatric disorders, or any brain injury; (d) no current substance abuse;
(e) able to complete a CRF assessment based on the Physical Activity Readiness Question-
naire (PAR-Q); (f) body mass index (BMI) within the normal-weight (
BMI = 18.5–24 kg/m
2
)
or within the obese range (BMI > 27 kg/m
2
) based on the normative BMI data for Tai-
wanese adults published by the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Taiwan; (g) CRF level
either above the 65th percentile or below the 35th percentile, as reflected by the maximaloxygen uptake (VO
2max
) index, based on the norms provided by the American College
of Sports Medicine [
30
]; and (h) right-handed.  The experimental protocol for the study
was approved by the Institutional Review Board of National Taiwan University. Following
an initial screening, 92 eligible participants were grouped into four mutually exclusivegroups: the high CRF with normal weight (NH,
n
= 23) group, high CRF with obesity (OH,
n
=23
) group, low CRF with normal weight (NL,
n
= 23) group, and low CRF with obesity
(OL,
n
= 23) group. The demographic data and working memory aspect of the intelligence
quotient of each participant, as assessed by the Forward and Backward Digit Span Test of
the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition [
31
], were collected.
2.2. Submaximal Cardiorespiratory Fitness Assessment
All of the participants completed the YMCA cycling test [
32
], which is a submaximal
CRF test and has been described as effective in predicting VO
2max
[
33
]. The test consists
of three consecutive 3-min cycling stages.  For each participant, the test began with a
3-min warm-up stage involving exercising on a braked cycle ergometer (Ergoselect 100/200Ergoline GmbH, Germany) at 150 kpm/min (25 W) and pedaling at a constant speedof
50 rpm
. The subsequent stages of power output progression were determined by the
given participant’s steady-state HR recorded during the last 15–30 s of the initial 3-min
warm-up stage. An additional 3-min stage was added if the participant’s target HR (i.e.,
85% of the individual’s age-predicted HRmax) was not achieved. The result for the BorgRating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale [
34
] was recorded at the end of every 3-min stage
during the exercise period.  Finally, each participant’s VO
2max
was predicted using the
extrapolation method.2.3. Stop-Signal Task (SST)
The SST conducted using the e-prime software was adopted from Johnstone, et al. [
35
].
The go-trials of the SST consist of leftward- or rightward-pointing black arrows (
←
or
→
)
with 196
×
42 pixels (hereafter referred to as go stimuli).  The probability of a leftward-
or rightward-pointing arrow occurring for any trial was 50%. A plus sign was presentedas the fixation for 500 ms at the beginning of each trial. Following the plus sign, a blankscreen (100 ms) and the go stimuli (500 ms) were presented sequentially. Participants wereinstructed to press the response button on the response box corresponding to the directionof each presented arrow (that is, they were asked to press the left response button for aleftward-pointing arrow and the right response button for a rightward-pointing arrow) as
quickly and accurately as possible.
When presented, the stop stimulus (i.e., a red square superimposed on the go stimulus)
was displayed with a certain delay (i.e., the stop-signal delay, SSD) following the go stimu-
lus onset. The given participant was asked to withdraw their response when they detectedthe presence of the stop-signal stimulus (with each trial involving the stop-signal stimulushereafter referred to as a stop-trial). The SSD was initially set to
200 ms
, and dynamically
37

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health

,
18
, 3429
varied between 50 ms and 450 ms according to each participant’s ongoing performance.
Specifically, the SSD was increased by 50 ms if the participant could successfully withdrawtheir response during the previous stop-trial and decreased by 50 ms if the participantfailed to withdraw their response during the previous stop-trial. With the dynamic trackingalgorithm, success in withholding the response was achieved for approximately 50% of thestop-trials. Presentation of the go- and stop-trials was randomized to prevent subjectiveexpectancy. A low proportion of stop signals (i.e., 25%) was chosen for the trials in order toincrease the strength of the conflicting stimuli. Finally, the SSRT of each participant wascalculated by subtracting the participant’s average SSD from their average response timeduring the go-trial (i.e., the mean go-trial RT).2.4. Psychophysiological Recording and Data Analysis
For each participant, the brain electrical activity was recorded continuously from
32 Ag/AgCl scalp electrodes of the international 10-20 system inserted in an elastic cap
(Quick-Cap, NeuroScan Inc.) and referenced to the left and right mastoids. The horizontal
electrooculogram (HEOG) was recorded from two electrodes attached laterally to each eyeto monitor horizontal eye movements. Vertical eye movements and blinks (the VEOG) wererecorded from two electrodes attached above and below the left eye. The electrode locatedon the mid-forehead was used as the ground electrode. The impedance of all the electrodesthroughout the recording period was maintained below 10 k
Ω
. The online EEG signal was
digitized at a rate of 500 Hz and amplified by a SynAmps EEG amplifier filtered with abandpass between 70 Hz and 0.05 Hz and with a 60-Hz notch filter to remove additionalelectrical noise with the NeuroScan equipment (NeuroScan Inc., El Paso, TX, USA).
The offline EEG data was then analyzed using the Scan software (NeuroScan Inc., El
Paso, TX, USA, v4.5). Only the successfully inhibited and corrected response trials wereincluded for further analysis. The offline EEG data was initially processed by correctingthe eye movements and blinks using the algorithm proposed by Semlitsch, et al. [
36
], and
an epoch of 1300 ms was segmented starting 100 ms prior to the onset of the go stimulusand lasting until 1200 ms after the go stimulus onset for each trial. The average artifact-freeepoch waveforms were computed for both go-trials and stop-trials.  The data was thendigitized and filtered with a bandpass filter between 0.05 and 30 Hz (12 dB/Oct). The EEGdata from poorly recorded channels and trials for which the amplitude exceeded
±
85
μ
V
was excluded from further analysis.
ERP averages were then computed for the successful stop-trials and the correct go-
trials for each individual. The initial time windows for the go-P3 (200–700 ms) componentduring the go-trials were determined based on the grand average waveforms of the fourgroups. The time windows for the stop-ERP components were determined from the averagestop-signal onset time with the consideration of variation in each individual’s SSD. That is,the final lower and upper time windows for each participant were equal to the smallestSSD plus the lower limit of the average stop-signal onset time and the largest SSD plus theupper limit of the average stop-signal onset time, respectively. Finally, for each individualP3 time window, the P3 amplitude, defined as the most positive value within the window,
was identified by means of an automatic pick-picking program using the Scan software
(NeuroScan, v4.5). In a similar manner, the N2 amplitude, which was defined as the most
negative value within the final time window, was also identified.2.5. Experimental Procedure
The participants were required to visit the laboratory located on the National Taiwan
Sport University campus individually on two occasions separated by less than seven daysfrom each other.  In order to measure the body-weigh accurately, all participants wereinstructed to avoid having any food for 8 h prior their body-weight measurements. Ad-ditionally, they were informed not to consume any food or drink containing caffeine oralcohol and to avoid engaging in any strenuous exercise for 12 h prior to second experi-mental session in an effort to reduce any effect of stimuli on the cardiovascular system.

During the first visit, the experimental procedure was introduced by the researchers
conducting the experiment, and informed written consent was obtained from the given
participant. After the informed consent was completed, information regarding the partici-pant’s health/physical condition was acquired by filling out the demographic and PAR-Q
questionnaires. The participant’s BMI was then calculated based on their weight (kg) and
height (m), and the participant’s score on the Digit Span Test was recorded.  Followingconfirmation that the health condition and BMI status of the participant met the inclusioncriteria, the participant was fitted with a Polar heart rate monitor (Sport Tester PE 3000,Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland) and instructed to perform the YMCA cycling test at aroom temperature of 20
◦
C. The resting HR (HR rest) of the participant was measured after
the participant sat still for 5 min. The participant’s HR during the exercise was recordedevery 2 min. Those participants who met the inclusion criteria were invited to return forthe second experimental session.
During their second visit, each qualified participant was seated comfortably in a chair
in a dimly lit, sound-attenuated, air-conditioned, and electrically shielded room where theythen completed the SST. The viewing distance between the participant and the computerscreen was set at 70 cm. During the SST, the participant was instructed to focus on a centralfixation cross on the screen and to avoid making any body movements during the EEGrecording. Prior to being tested with the experimental blocks of the SST, the participantresponded to a practice block of 10 trials that allowed the participant to become familiar
with the task so that they could keep in mind that they should inhibit their response when
the stop signals appeared in the stop-trials. Furthermore, the importance of responding
quickly to the go stimuli was emphasized, and the participant was told not to sacrifice
response speed by waiting for the occurrence of the stop signals. Time was taken to ensurethat each participant clearly understood the test prior to the experimental blocks being
presented. After the practice block, two experimental blocks, each containing 200 trials,
were presented.  A 5-min break was taken halfway through each block, and a 15-min
break was taken between the two blocks. EEG recordings were taken throughout the task
performance period.  The duration of the experiment was about 1.5 h.  Each participant
received a payment of approximately US $30 for travel expenses incurred.2.6. Statistical Analysis
The demographic data was analyzed using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
among the four groups (i.e., the NH, OH, NL, and OL groups). For behavioral data, the
ANOVA was also conducted for the go RTs, which were defined as the time intervals
between the onsets of the go stimuli and the correct responses made by the participants; theaccuracy of the go-trials; and the SSRTs. For electrophysiological data, a separate ANOVA
was also conducted for the go- and stop-P3 amplitudes at the parietal region (the averaged
ERP from the P3, Pz, and P4 electrode locations). Finally, post-hoc Tukey HSD and multiplet-test comparisons with Bonferroni correction were conducted where appropriate.  Allstatistical analyses were carried out using SPSS (version 21.0, IBM, Corp., Armonk, NY,USA). Mean and standard error (SE) values were presented.3. Results3.1. Participant Characteristics
The demographic background data of the participants is summarized in Table

ANOVA revealed that there were no significant differences among the four groups in terms
of age (years), height (cm), or working memory performance.

4. Discussion
The purpose of the current study was to examine the interrelationship between CRF
and excessive weight in terms of their combined effects on response inhibition inducedby the SST from both behavioral and ERP perspectives. Our primary behavioral findingsrevealed that the participants with high CRF levels, regardless of their normal or excessive
weight status, had superior response inhibition in comparison to the participants with low
CRF levels. Furthermore, the individuals with normal weight and high CRF demonstrateda  higher  accuracy  rate  than  the  other  three  groups.   With  regard  to  ERP  indices,  theindividuals  with  normal  weight  and  high  CRF  exhibited  significantly  larger  go-  andstop-P3 amplitudes than the obese individuals with low CRF levels, while no significantdifferences in the P3 amplitudes were observed among the other three groups.4.1. Behavioral Performance
Superior performance under time pressure reflected by faster response times (in terms
of go RTs) was observed among the participants with high CRF (i.e., the NH and OHgroups) in comparison to the participants with low CRF (i.e., the NL and OL groups).
These findings are consistent with those of prior research reporting that young adults with
higher fitness levels had shorter go RTs during the neutral condition of the Stroop task [
22
],
and the congruent condition of the Erickson flanker task [
37
].  However, similar go RTs
for active and non-active young adults have also previously been observed [
16
,
17
], which
is somewhat inconsistent with our findings in the present study. This inconsistency maybe linked to the categories of CRF levels used in the different studies.  Specifically, theaverage CRF levels for the non-active participants in the study by Padilla and colleagues
were 44.43 and 48.00 mL/kg/min, respectively, which were higher than those of the low-
fitness participants in the current study (35.79 and 36.45 mL/kg/min for the NL and OLgroups, respectively). That is, our findings might represent the influence of relatively lowCRF levels on the go RT. Given that go RT reflects the time required for the generalized
processing needed for stimulus identification, stimulus discrimination, response choice,
42

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health
2021
,
18
, 3429
and response execution [
38
], CRF may have a positive influence on the general processing
speed relative to the weight status during the SST.
Our SSRT results revealed that one difference between the high- and low-fitness
participants was in response inhibition ability, with the shorter SSRTs of the participants
with high CRF indicating their superior response inhibition compared to their low CRF
counterparts. Such superior inhibition on the part of the high CRF participants was in line
with previous studies regarding CRF. For example, previous studies have reported that
active individuals demonstrated shorter SSRTs in the more executive control-demanding
version of the SST compared to their inactive counterparts [
16
,
17
]. Other studies using the
Erickson flanker task also found that higher CRF is associated with outcomes indicatingsuperior inhibition, such as smaller flanker effects in older adults [
39
,
40
], better ability to
maintain response accuracy across task conditions [
25
], and less response variability [
41
]
in children. Consistent with this positive association, prior research has further reportedsuperior performance in the incongruent condition of the Stroop task among older [
42
] and
young adult [
22
] populations with higher fitness levels.
The covert behavioral response of SST (i.e., success or failure to withhold the on-going
go-process) could be interpreted by the “horse-race” model [
7
], which indicates that the stop
performance is determined by the “race” between the go-process and stop-process; that is,
a participant will not be able to withhold or terminate their pre-potent response if the “go”
process finishes the race before the "stop" process does (i.e., when go
RT < (SSRT + SSD)
)[
7
].
Accordingly,  successful  withholding  of  the  ongoing  go-process  could  be  achieved  by
decreasing the tendency toward executing covert behavioral responses, through either orboth of slowing the go RT and shortening the SSRT, for a given SSD [
43
]. Notably, although
faster general cognitive processing speed (i.e., shorter go RTs) observed in individuals with
higher CRF (i.e., NH and OH group) might imply a higher tendency toward executing theongoing go-process, the superior response inhibition (i.e., shorter SSRTs) in the NH and OHgroups might suggest greater effects of CRF on the processing of stop-signal detection andthe initiating of the response inhibition. Additionally, the higher accuracy rates and shortergo RTs demonstrated by the NH group further indicate that this superior performance wasnot caused by a speed-accuracy trade-off during the task performance.  Taken together,and in addition to the prior findings indicating a positive association between CRF andinhibition, the data collected in the current study thus provide further evidence indicatinga beneficial effect of CRF on response inhibition.
Contrary to our predictions, however, our results revealed no differences in response
inhibition across weight categories in terms of SSRT performance. While negative associa-tions between the standard SSRT and obesity in adults [
10
,
44
] and children [
45
–
47
] have
previously been reported, non-significant differences in SSRT between normal weight and
obese individuals have also been observed [
44
,
48
–
50
]. These inconsistent findings might
result from the types of stimuli used [
51
], as well as the association between obesity and EF
being altered by CRF. For instance, Edwards, Dankel, Loenneke and Loprinzi [
21
] reported
that lower executive performance was only related to the present inactivity of older adults,regardless of individuals’ past and current weight statuses.  Our previous findings alsosuggested that the inhibition levels assessed by the Stroop task were similar for high-fitness
participants with normal weight and high-fitness participants with obesity [
22
]. As such,
the results of the present study extend the current understanding of the interrelationshipbetween CRF and obesity in terms of their combined effects on EF, as well as furthersupporting the fat-but-fit paradigm in relation to response inhibition.4.2. ERP
Larger stop-P3 and go-P3 amplitudes were observed in the participants in this study
with normal weight and high fitness (i.e., the NH group) than in those with normal weight
and low fitness and those with obesity and low fitness (i.e.,  the NL and OL groups).
This observation of a fitness-related difference in P3 amplitudes corroborates the current
literature regarding fitness and response inhibition in young adult populations. Specifically,
43

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health
2021
,
18
, 3429
larger P3 amplitudes were previously observed for normal-weight young adults with highCRF levels than for their low-fitness counterparts, along with superior performance acrossboth the neutral and incongruent conditions of the Stroop task [
22
].  A similar pattern
has been reported in preadolescent children, that is, larger P3 amplitudes and superior
behavioral performance have been seen in high-fitness as compared to low-fitness healthy
preadolescent children [
25
,
26
].
Stop-P3 amplitude has previously been reported to be related to the active inhibitory
processing of motor responses released by the stop signal [
52
,
53
]. Based on the reduced P3
amplitudes in children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder during the Ericksonflanker task [
54
] and during the SST [
55
], it has been suggested that stop-P3 amplitudes
involve monitoring of the outcomes of the inhibitory process and its efficiency. In conse-
quence, the larger stop-P3 amplitudes among individuals in the NH group in the current
study might reflect a surplus in cognitive control abilities affecting overall performancemonitoring. This hypothesis is supported by a previously reported positive associationbetween CRF and the volume of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and reduced ACCactivity reflecting better conflict monitoring after aerobic exercise interventions [
40

],
as well as studies linking ACC activity with the monitoring of go and stop performancein response inhibition [
43
].  Therefore, the enhanced modulation of the P3 component
observed in the NH group in this study may result from functional and structural changesof the ACC.
P3  amplitude  has  also  been  associated  with  the  amount  of  attentional  resources
allocated during a cognitive task [
27
] as well as enhanced go response processing [
53
]. As
a result, the larger stop- and go-P3 amplitudes observed in the NH group might reflect asuperior ability to allocate larger amounts of attentional resources, less impulsivity, andfaster processing speed for go signals.  Given the shorter go RTs and SSRTs, as well asthe findings regarding P3 amplitudes, observed for the NH group, it is conceivable thatthe higher fitness levels of this group cooperated with their normal weight statuses to
provide superior abilities in terms of several neuroelectrical processes related to both
overall processing speed as well as inhibition.
It is important to note that, while the individuals in the NH group demonstrated
the largest P3 amplitudes compared to the participants in the low-fitness groups, the P3
measure itself partly consisted of behavioral performance; that is, despite the OH groupdemonstrating similar overt stopping performance compared to the NH group, the meanP3 amplitude of the OH group was attenuated and did not differ significantly from those ofthe NL and OL groups. This finding might indicate that the OH group had, in comparisonto the NH group, less attentional resource allocation and/or weaker activation levels that
were not observable through their overt behavior alone. Additionally, the finding of no
difference in P3 amplitudes for the NL group compared with OH and OL groups was
partially consistent with of our prior study [
22
], in which no difference in behavioral results
and P3 amplitudes between NL, OH, and OL groups was reported. However, the findingsfrom both studies might suggest that young adults with normal weight and low CRFlevels have lower levels of response inhibition, at least from the neuroelectrical perspective,similar to those of the obese population.
There are several potential mechanisms through which higher CRF might alleviate
the adverse effects associated with obesity.  Firstly, the reduction of cerebral blood flow
associated with obesity [
57
] might be countered by the improved cerebral blood flow regu-
lation resulting from exercise and/or higher CRF, as both exercise and higher CRF havebeen associated with better cerebral blood flow regulation in young adults [
58
] and older
adults [
59
].  Another mechanism might be related to the ameliorating effects of CRF on
the chronic systematic inflammation associated with obesity [
60
]. This systematic inflam-
mation might lead to neuroinflammation in certain brain regions (i.e., the hypothalamus),and inflammatory biomarkers (i.e., interleukin-1 beta) have also been associated with thesuppression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling [
61
], which has vital importance
in neuronal repair, neuronal survival, neurogenesis, and neuroplasticity [
62
]. In contrast,
44

, 3429
CRF has been associated with reduced levels of inflammatory biomarkers and enhancedBDNF levels [
63
].  Therefore, CRF might alleviate the adverse effects of obesity and ul-
timately enhance cognitive function.  Finally, prior research has also provided evidenceof an association between higher CRF with larger brain volumes (i.e., prefrontal cortex,
basal ganglia, and caudate nucleus volumes) and superior cognitive function [
64
–
66
]. This
might also contribute to alleviation of the negative impacts of obesity on brain volumesand cognitive function [
67
–
69
].
4.3. Limitations and Future Directions
Due to various limitations, the findings of the current study should be interpreted
with some caution. Firstly, the study’s cross-sectional design prevents any interpretations
regarding causality [
70
]. However, the current study took an initial step in identifying the
interrelationships among CRF, obesity, and response inhibition, thereby providing a basisfrom which to determine the associated cause-effect relationships. Another limitation ofthis study, meanwhile, is related to its generalizability in terms of population given thatonly young male adults were recruited. Females have been demonstrated to have superiorbehavioral inhibitory performance, as well as shorter latencies and larger amplitudes inseveral ERP components, than males [
71
], implying that gender differences should also
be taken into consideration. Finally, the establishment of obesity status in this study wasbased only on BMI scores, and although BMI scores have been widely utilized in studies ofobesity, BMI is a measure of body fatness rather than exact body fat. As such, measures ofbody composition or biochemical indices might provide more accurate classifications ofobesity and reveal different results [
72
].
5. Conclusions
The current study provides empirical evidence regarding the interrelationships among
CRF, obesity, and response inhibition.  Additionally, by employing ERPs, it allowed usto further identify the potential underlying neuronal mechanisms. In brief, young adults
with higher levels of CRF, regardless of their weight status, were found to exhibit superior
performance in terms of response inhibition. Moreover, the high CRF participants were
also observed to have superior attentional resource allocation and inhibitory processingspeeds, as well as higher efficiency in terms of the executive control system. Future researchemploying randomized controlled trials is thus warranted to examine how CRF and weightstatus changes might be related to the degree of EF benefits achieved.

Abstract:
Background
: Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are people who have been forced to flee
their homes due to disasters. Depressive symptoms, at over 31–67%, are prevalent in IDPs in Africa.Despite the evidence for the benefits of the promotion of dance interventions on psychologicalhealth, supporting information is needed to outline the benefits of an African Circle Dance (ACD)intervention for IDPs in Africa.
Methods
: A quasi-experimental design (pre-/post-test) was employed.
Two IDP camps were randomized into the intervention group (psychoeducation and ACD interven-
tion) and the control group (psychoeducation). Adults aged
≥
18 years, living in an IDP camp, able
to perform brisk walking, and who scored
≥
10 on a depressive symptoms subscale were recruited.
The intervention group received an 8-week ACD dance intervention and two 1-h psychoeducation
sessions on stress management; the controls only received the psychoeducation sessions. Outcomes
were depressive symptoms, stress, and anxiety. Data were collected at baseline (T0), immediately
after the intervention at week 8 (T1), and at week 12 (T2) at the post-intervention and follow-upsession.  A generalized estimating equation was used to test the effects of the ACD intervention,
with a 0.05 significance level.
Results
:  198 IDPs completed the study (n
control
= 98; n
intervention
=
100). The intervention group reported significantly greater improvements in depressive symptoms
(
v
= 0.33
,
p
< 0.001) and stress (
v
= 0.15, 0.008) than did the control group.
Conclusions
: ACD could be
a valuable complementary intervention in health promotion but more research is needed.Keywords:

1. Introduction
Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are defined as people who are forced by disasters
to flee their places of residence and go elsewhere within the borders of their country [
1
].
The internal displacement of people through violence is a globally prevalent issue that
affects approximately 45.7 million people, equivalent to around 0.6% of the world’s popula-tion [
2
]. They are more frequently found in several countries, including Syria, Democratic
Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Burkina Faso, and Afghanistan [
2
]. A majority of them are
African [
3
]. Displaced people face numerous challenges, including psychological trauma;
however, mental health problems (e.g., stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms) arecommonly neglected [
4
].
Traumatic experiences are inevitable throughout human life [
5
].  Traumatic experi-
ences in some populations are often the result of disasters such as conflicts, tsunamis,
and earthquake [
6
]. Recently, internal displacement as a result of conflicts is increasingly
prevalent [
7
]. In general, evidence has shown that victims of traumatic experiences were
prone to psychoemotional problems such as anxiety and depressive symptoms [
8
].
Depressive symptoms are the manifestation of sadness, disruptive patterns of sleep,
poor appetite, depressed mood, loss of pleasure or interest, and low self-worth or feelings
of guilt, resulting in impaired functioning or psychological distress [
9
]. Stress is strongly

associated with the development of depressive symptoms [
10
].  When left unmanaged,
stress could cause anxiety [
11
].  Depressive symptoms are found in 5–80% of globally
dispersed IDPs [
12
], with 31–67% in Africa, and 80.3% in Asia [
3
,
13
]. Such symptoms are
associated with functional impairment, low quality of life, short life expectancies, substanceabuse, reduced work productivity, and suicidal deaths [
14
].
To date, conventional treatments for depressive symptoms had depended on pharma-
cological approaches, despite the known association between the use of drugs and adverseeffects, including erectile dysfunction, anxiety, and insomnia [
15
]. Non-pharmacological
approaches are arguably preferable because of their limited adverse effects [
16
].  Non-
pharmacological  strategies  involving  psychological  health  interventions  such  as  psy-
chotherapy (e.g., cognitive behavioural therapy), physical health interventions (e.g., TaiChi), physical activity (e.g., moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic exercise) and digi-tal health and dietary health interventions have been shown to be effective at reducing
depressive symptoms [
17
–
20
]. However, many of the interventions require cultural adapta-
tions if they are to be practiced [
21
]. The implementation of certain non-pharmacological
interventions (e.g., psychotherapy) might be compromised because these interventionsdemand highly trained specialists. Systematic reviews showed that exercise is effectiveto reduce depressive symptoms in many populations, including older people [
22
], adoles-
cents [
23
], people with various chronic illnesses, such as major depressive disorder [
24
],
and neurologic disorder [
25
]. In particular, aerobic exercises demonstrated a larger effect
compared to other forms of exercises (e.g., stretching) [
26
]. The benefits of physical activity
demands intensive physical activities, but adults with depression have barriers againstexercises, most commonly exemplified by their lack of motivation, exhaustion, and lack ofaccess to adequate exercising environments [
27
], plausibly explaining their high attrition
rates [
28
]. However, psychoeducation can help people strengthen their coping strategies
which are needed to manage stress and preserve mental health.  A systematic reviewwith a meta-analysis indicated that psychoeducation is both effective in reducing stress
(d = 0.27) [
29
], and in helping people to manage stress due to trauma.  There is a need
to develop a cost-effective and culturally-adapted non-pharmacological intervention for
African IDPs. A dance intervention refers to the use of body movements in response to
musical sounds [
30
]. The intervention can be performed individually with a dance partner
or in a group. Dance interventions have been proven to strengthen empowerment, accep-tance and embodied self-trust [
31
], and to effectively reduce depressive symptoms [
30
].
Dance interventions have been found to effectively reduce depressive symptoms in adult
populations [
31
]. A circle is frequently used in the profession of dance/movement ther-
apy, and a circle dance may be using healing elements of dance/movement therapy [
32
].
An African Circle Dance (ACD) is an African traditional dance that is performed cere-
monially as well as on other occasions, where a group of people dance in a circle with
the accompaniment of drums [
33
,
34
]. ACD may be more readily acceptable to the general
African population than other forms of using dance as a therapy [
33
,
34
].
Dance interventions have been shown in the literature to have favourable effects on
many mental health symptoms (e.g., depressive symptoms) [
30
,
35
]. Dance intervention
for  the  disadvantaged  adults  with  depression  was  found  to  be  acceptable  (e.g.,  with
opportunity to connect with others, subjects do not want it to stop) [
36
]. African dance is
a conduit of individual and community healing as Africans conceptualize illness and healthas an integration of the social, physical and mental realms:  which all of these could beimpacted by trauma [
37
]. Because of its potential healing effect, it is adopted and modified
purposefully as a therapeutic modality to treat mental health symptoms in African people
facing adversity. ACD is not novel as a ceremonial activity, but its effect on treating mentalhealth symptoms in African IDP is novel. However, its healing effects on mental symptomshave never been examined among IDPs.
Folkman and Lazarus’ stress and coping theory is widely used and was chosen to
guide this study because it is able to guide the development of many creative arts in-terventions for the management of stress and related emotional outcomes (e.g., anxiety
50

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health

, 843
and depression) [
38
,
39
].  Many research indicated that dancing intervention is effective
in addressing moderate and mild depression but they are limited to high attrition ratein some studies [
40
]. IDPs often experience anxiety and stress from having to deal with
unfamiliar environments, a loss of family, and previous trauma.  Stress is known to be
associated with negative affections (e.g., symptoms of anxiety and depression) [
41
]. Coping
is an individual’s effort to manage internal/external demands by marshalling availableresources [
42
]. When confronted by this stressor (e.g., displacement), IDPs choose available
measures to decrease their stress and enhance their ability to cope.  In this study, ACD
was chosen as the intervention component because (a) it is widely accepted in IDP peo-
ple, (b) could be applied to people with a traumatic experience, and (c) is in line with
the needs for psychological rehabilitation in trauma-informed care as it evokes abnormalresponses [
40
].  In this study, we employed psychoeducation and an ACD intervention
as components to promote the psychological wellbeing of IDPs [
43
]. Psychoeducation is
evidently an effective strategy to enhance psychological wellbeing [
44
]. For the content,
we included the essential knowledge of daily stress management tips and available re-
sources to seek necessary help to enhance the IDPs’ coping skills in the camps. Suggestionson positive health behaviour such as physical activities, environmental management, self-care, and other coping techniques were also made to enhance their psychological wellbeing
(The contents of the psychoeducation will be further described below).
In the ACD intervention, dancing processes were employed to cope with the stressors.
ACD comprises two major therapeutic components, which are body movement and music.
They interplay with one another through dancing (e.g., tapping the rhythm of music) to
stimulate interoception, which is the process of sensory information inside the body beingtransmitted and communicated to the brain and other body structures that occurs withor without conscious attention [
45
].  Interoception acts as distractors to shift a person’s
attention away from the negative experience and replace it with positive thoughts [
46
].
This shifting of attention serves as one of the emotion-focused coping strategies allowing
the person to cope with stress. As a result, stress and negative emotions could be healed [
46
].
There is evidence showing that dance interventions,  including African dance,  reduce
physiological stress, perceived stress, and negative affect in various populations (e.g., olderpeople and college students) [
47
,
48
].
2. Methods
A quasi-experimental design was adopted. Two IDP camps of similar size and run
under the same government were chosen and randomised into an intervention group
and a control group. This study was reported using the Transparent Reporting of Evalua-tions with Non-randomized Designs (TREND) reporting guideline [
49
] (Supplementary
Material). The study was conducted between 7th December 2019 and 15th March 2020.2.1. Ethical Considerations
Ethical approval was obtained from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (HSEARS-
20190802005), the Borno State Ministry of Health (MOH/GEN/6679/1), and the StateEmergency Management Agency (BO/SEMA/56/VOL.II/33). After being given an expla-nation of the study, eligible clients were invited to participate, giving their signed writtenconsent. The participation of the clients was voluntary, and they were well-informed aboutthe purpose, nature, and procedure of the study. The anonymity of the participants andconfidentiality of their data were closely monitored.2.2. Participants
Subjects were recruited using convenience sampling. All participants were recruited
from their respective camp of residence. With the approval of the camp management office,the officers of the psychosocial support units of the IDP camps approached the potential
participants and the officers refer them to the research assistants for eligibility screening.
The principal researcher placed the information leaflet about the programme in places
51

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health

18
, 843
between the two centres in order to invite people to come for a dance programme screening.Potential participants were told about the ACD programme, potential risks and benefits,as well as their ethic rights (e.g., rights to withdraw) as stipulated on the consent form.
The criteria for inclusion in the study were those: (1) aged
≥
18 years, (2) who lived in one
of the two IDP camps, (3) exhibited depressive symptoms, as defined by a Depression
Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) score of
≥
20 [
50
], and (4) had good mobility, as defined by
a score of 7 in the modified Functional Ambulatory Classification (mFAC) [
51
]. Exclusion
criteria were those (1) with a history of disabling diseases such as chronic arthritis, primary
pulmonary diseases (requiring long-term oxygen therapy), and cardiac diseases (e.g., end-
stage heart failure), which might limit their ability to participate in dancing, and (2) who
were unable to communicate in the Nigerian Hausa language.
The displaced individuals involved in this study lived with their family members
in the Muna Garage and Teachers Village IDP camps [
52
,
53
].  They fled their homes be-
cause of an on-going ethno-religious crisis, and a significant proportion of them sufferedfrom mental distress (e.g., depressive symptoms, stress [
54
].  The two camps each held
between 31,019 and 39,560 people [
53
,
55
]. Both camps were managed by the State Emer-
gency Management Agency (SEMA) and supported by Non-Governmental Organizations
(NGOs).
2.3. Interventions2.3.1. Development of Psychoeducation Talks
Since psychoeducation has proven to be an effective strategy to help people cope
with stress [
29
], we adopted it as the standard care for stress management.  It was pro-
vided to both groups to ensure that subjects who were identified as having depressive
symptoms would receive an evidence-based intervention to manage their psychologicalsymptoms [
56
].
Psychoeducation  was  delivered  by  adopting  the  teaching  contents  of  “10  stress
Busters” developed by the National Health System because they were developed forlaypeople to self-practice [
57
].  It does not require healthcare professionals, which are
in shortage in IDP camps, to deliver.  These items were grouped into (a) Positive health
behaviour which includes: (1) avoid unhealthy habits, (2) work smarter, not harder, (3) chal-lenge yourself, (4) be active, and (5) take control. (b) To provide support on how to copeand adjust their daily life in IDPs camp using the resources available:  (1) connect with
people, (2) have some ‘me time’, (3) help other people, (4) try to be positive, and (5) accept
the things you can’t change [
57
]. They were also advised to seek professional help in terms
of sickness or counselling using the camp clinic. To adapt these educational contents for
people who might struggle with literacy, we incorporated pictures and posters to guide
the teaching process. A mental health nurse delivered psychoeducation at the IDP campsto groups of 20–50 participants. We verbally met camp officers and told them our study
plans (protocol plan for intervention, schedule of the programme and psychoeducational
contents) were presented.2.3.2. Development of the ACD Dance Protocol
The ACD programme was developed through a two-stage process: (1) a systematic
review of randomised controlled trials and (2) a Delphi process. In the systemic review,trials (
n
= 25) examining the effect of a dance intervention on depressive symptoms in vari-
ous populations (e.g., dementia, breast cancer) were identified. Guided by the templatefor intervention description and replication (TIDieR) checklist (e.g., materials, dosage),components of the interventions were extracted from the identified articles [
58
]. System-
atic reviews showed that an effective dance intervention is comprised of the followingfeatures:  (1) administered by a dance therapist or specialist, (2) delivered face-to-face,
(3) the dance load of each session
≥
30 min, (4) 1–4 sessions per week, (5) and with a du-
ration of 6–12 weeks [
59
,
60
]. We subsequently consulted a panel of experts and potential
participants (
n
=8
), including professors with experience in designing a study with music
52

or educational intervention (
n
= 2), a dance specialist (
n
= 1), a nurse (
n
= 1), a psychologist
(
n
=1)
, a psychiatrist (
n
= 1), and IDPs (
n
= 2). Finally, we revised the intervention protocol
according to the panel’s comments and finalized the intervention protocol after achievinga full consensus in the second round of consultations through a Delphi process [
61
].
2.3.3. Intervention Group
The participants of the intervention group received the same psychoeducation, in ad-
dition to a 75-min ACD session weekly for eight weeks.  Table
1
showed the details of
the ACD session: a 5-min briefing session, subjects were given the opportunity to introducethemsleves briefly, after which the day activity was introduced. At this stage, the physicalcondition of the subjects was seen, followed by a 10-min warm-up session of stretchingexercises. A 50-min ACD session was then led by a dance specialist. During the dancing
period, a band of musicians (i.e., two drummers and one flautist) employed Ganga Kura
drums and an Algaita (i.e., a traditional African flute) to play the African music. The partic-ipants danced alongside the music in a circle made up of a group of participants. The dancetype was called Maliki, which is a popular Kanuri (i.e., name of a tribe in North-EasternNigeria) traditional dance. The dance movements began at a point of a circle and it endedat the same point of the circle.  The participants partnered with another participant ofthe opposite sex and danced together in the circle.  The dancing movements involvedmultiple body parts (i.e., legs, hands, heads, fingers and torso).  The rhythm is key tothe dance movements and the participants dance in response to the music that it is likea conversation between the participants and music, and vice-versa. A 10 min cool-downsession was followed.  In this phase, the musical rhythm and dancing movement fadedgradually towards the end. The same set dancing procedures (i.e., dancing pattern andmusic) repeated every week. A dance specialist is an expert with a definitive knowledge ofa particular dance that is required by others, and was able to show essential dance stan-dards by act demonstration [
62
]. The dance specialist, who is registered at the Borno State
Ministry of Art and Culture, Nigeria, delivered the ACD intervention for the interventiongroup for the whole eight weeks. Eight sub-group sessions with 12–13 participants wereconducted according to the protocol.

ACD: African Circle Dance, #measured by Depression, Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21).
2.3.5. Trial Process
The whole ACD programme lasted for a period of 12 weeks, excluding two weeks
baseline period.  Eight weeks was used as the treatment phase, and four weeks follow-up period (Table
2
).  At week 1 and 4, psychoeducation was delivered.  Outcomes were
assessed at baseline, week 8 and 12. During the treatment phase, compliance, withdrawals,and adverse events/safety were assessed.2.4. Objective
The objective of this study was, therefore, to evaluate the effects of ACD on the de-
pressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress of IDPs who display depressive symptoms. We hy-pothesised that depressive symptoms, stress and anxiety reduce more in the intervention
group than in the control group.2.5. Outcomes
Demographic data (i.e., age, gender, education, employment, marital status, use of
anti-depressive drugs) and clinical data (i.e., depressive symptoms, stress, anxiety, socialsupport, and coping) were collected at T0. The primary outcome of this study was depres-sive symptoms, and the secondary outcomes were anxiety and stress.  Trained researchassistants collected data at baseline (T0), in the week immediately after the completion ofthe 8-week intervention (T1), and four weeks after the completion of the intervention (T2).
A Hausa-language version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale—short form (DASS-
21) was employed to measure the three outcome variables because it comprises of threeconstructs (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress) and 21 items [
63
]. Each construct is mea-
sured  by  seven  items  and  each  item  assessing  an  emotional  state  is  quantified  usinga 4-point scale (i.e., 0 = never, an
d 3 = almost always).  Each subscale score of DASS-21
ranged from 0 to 21. To obtain a score similar to the DASS—full form which is comprisedof 42 items, each DASS-21 subscale score was doubled so that each subscale score rangedfrom 0 to 42 [
64
].  The depression subscale score was interpreted as normal (0–9), mild
(10–13), moderate (14–20), severe (21–27), and extremely severe (28+); the anxiety sub-
54

, 843
scale score was interpreted as normal (0–7), mild (8–9), moderate (10–14), severe (15–19),and extremely severe (20+); the stress subscale score was interpreted as normal (0–14), mild
(15–18), moderate (19-25), severe (26–33), and extremely severe (34+) [
65
]. DASS-21 was
found to have good internal consistency (
α
= 0.82–0.93) and inter-rater reliability (ICC =
0.82–0.86) [
66
].  With regards to convergent and discriminant validity, the DASS-21 has
a positive correlation with Beck’s Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Beck’s Depression Inventory
(BDI) (r = 0.5–0.8) [
67
]. It is negatively associated with positive affectivity and positively
correlated with negative affectivity scales [
68
]. The DASS-21 scale has an inverse correlation
with quality of life measures [
69
].  The concurrent validity of the DASS-21 is good as it
shows adequate discrimination of both clinical and non-clinical samples and other specificgroups [
70
]. This tool was translated into the Hausa African language, culturally adapted,
and psychometrically tested. It was found to have an overall internal consistency of 0.8,and 0.7 for stress, depression, and anxiety, respectively [
63
].
2.6. Sample Size
The sample size was estimated using GLIMMPSE, based on an a priori power analysis
employing a general linear mixed model [

]. We estimated the effect size from a similar
study that evaluated the effect of a dance intervention on depression in the interventiongroup at T0 (mean = 16.00, SD = 12.35) and T1 (mean = 8.76, SD = 9.64); and in the controlgroup at T0 (mean = 18.62, SD = 11.98) and T1 (mean = 16.92, SD = 9.74) [
72
]. Given that
the attrition rate of a similar study was about 10% at 3 months [
72
], the minimum total
sample size needed was 182 at a 0.05 level of significance and 0.8 power.2.7. Assignment Methods
This study was conducted in two IDP camps: Muna Garage and Teacher’s Village,
North-Eastern Nigeria.  One camp was assigned to one single group to prevent effect
contamination within the same venue. The group assignment was determined by simplerandomisation using the coin flipping method [
73
]. Muna Garage camp was assigned as
the intervention group and Teacher’s Village camp as the control group.2.8. Blinding
The outcome assessors were only blinded to the group label of the study because
it was not possible to blind the interventionist and participants.  Due to the nature of
the intervention, it was difficult to blind the participants and the interventionists.2.9. Unit of Analysis
Groups of individuals were assigned to study conditions.   (i.e.,  intervention and
control groups).  The analyses were performed at the group level, where mixed effectsmodels (via generalised estimating equations) were employed to account for random
subject effects within each group.2.10. Statistical Methods
We used IBM SPSS statistical software version 20 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA) to
analyse the data. The demographic and clinical profiles of the participants at baseline weredescribed using mean with standard deviation and frequency with percentage accordingto their level of measurement. The balance of the baseline characteristics was comparedthrough either a Chi-square or independent t-test according to their level of measurement.Outcomes at different time points were described by groups using mean and standarderror.
To evaluate the effects of the ACD programme, generalized estimating equations (GEE)
were employed. The dependent variables were depressive symptoms, stress, and anxiety.
The independent variables were groups (i.e.,  intervention vs control),  time (i.e.,  base-
line, week 8, and week 12), and group x time. All equations were adjusted for potential
confounding factors, which were determined by two principles:
55

, 843
(1)
Demographic variables that are known to be associated with dependent variablesin the literature (i.e., age, gender, education, marital status, and employment) [
74
],
and
(2)
Outcome variables (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress) that were not balanced be-tween groups at baseline because they are known to be associated [
75
].
The results of both adjusted values were reported. Due to unbalanced characteristics
between groups, we adjusted the equations because this was not a randomised controlledtrial in which potential confounding factors could alter the effects of the intervention onthe outcomes. We set the level of significance at 0.05. The effect size was reported usingthe Cramer’s V [
76
].  The score was interpreted as very weak (0–0.04), weak (0.05–0.09),
moderate (0.10–0.14), strong (0.15–0.25), and very strong (>0.25) [
77
]. Missing data were
handled using an inverse-probability weight GEE if the assumption of missing-at-random
was fulfilled [
78
].
3. Results3.1. Participant Flow
As can be seen in Figure
1
, 280 subjects were approached for screening.  Fifteen of
them were not eligible, and 67 declined to participate. In the end, 198 participants wererecruited and allocated to either the experimental (
n
= 100
) or the control (
n
= 98) group.
The recruitment rate was 70.7% (i.e., 198/280). All of the subjects received the interventions
and data collection was completed at T1. The attrition rate was 17% (
n
=17
) for the inter-
vention group and 10.2% (
n
= 10) for the control group at T2. All the eight dance subgroups
have completed their sessions 100%. However, subjects did not attend to all the sessions.
Therefore, the average dance attendance per subject in the intervention group was 79.5%;
and the overall attendance rate for the intervention group is 74.9%. For the control group
with only psychoeducational intervention, all subjects attended the two sessions at week 1
and 4 (i.e., 100%). We only have missing data at T2 in twenty-seven subjects on the outcome
variables. The reasons for the loss of follow-up were “change of camp” (
n
= 25) and “being
arrested” (
n
= 2).  The analysis included all subjects as assigned to the intervention and
control groups, respectively.3.2. Recruitment
The recruitment period was during 21st November 2019 to 5th December 2019 and
the follow-up period was during 9th to 15th March 2020.3.3. Baseline DataDemographic and Clinical Profiles at Baseline
As shown Table
3
,  the majority of participants were 18–29 years of age (
n
= 102,
51.5%), female (
n
= 127, 64.1%), unemployed (
n
= 184, 92.9%), uneducated (
n
= 147, 74.2%),
and married (
n
= 114, 57.6%). Less than 10% of the subjects were taking an anti-depressant
(
n
= 19, 9.6%).

3.4. Baseline Equivalence
The baseline group differences were assessed using the Chi-square test and indepen-
dent t-test for categorical and continuous variables. The groups were not balanced in termsof education (
p
= 0.038), marital status (
p
< 0.001), and depression (
p
< 0.001). However,
there was no group differences for gender (
p
= 0.582), age (
p
= 0.195), employment status
(
p
= 0.174), and use of anti-depressant (
p
= 0.774) (Table
3
).
3.5. Numbers Analysed
The analysis of ACD effects included all subjects that completed the interventions at
T1. Although we lost 27 subjects at follow-up, they were all included in the analysis (i.e.,
100 for the intervention group and 98 for control).
3.6. Outcomes and EstimationEffects of the ACD Intervention
As shown in Table
4
, in the adjusted model, the depressive symptoms reduced after
the completion of the intervention at both T1 and T2 significantly in both groups. The re-duction of depression in the intervention was larger than that of the control group witha very strong group*time interaction effect (
v
= 0.33,
p
< 0.001). The reduction was greater
in the intervention group than in the control group at both T1 (

4. Discussion4.1. Interpretation
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate on the effects of an
ACD programme (i.e., ACD in addition to psychoeducation) on mental health outcomes
(i.e., depressive symptoms, stress, and anxiety) among African IDPs. It is also the first study
to enquire whether ACD would enhance the effects of psychoeducation. This study showed
that the intervention could reduce depressive symptoms from severe to mild level, reduceanxiety from extremely severe to moderate level, and reduce stress from moderate level tonormal. The effects in the intervention group were very strong in depressive symptoms,and strong in stress than those in the control group. However, the effect in anxiety was
very weak.
ACD is a form of dance intervention. The literature suggests that dancing, including
African dance, is effective in reducing stress, as measured by perceived stress and salivary
cortisol [
79
]. Previous studies revealed that a reduction in stress is strongly associated with
a reduction in depressive symptoms [
75
]. The findings of this study provide preliminary
support for the view that ACD possibly reduces stress and depressive symptoms througha mechanism different from that employed in psychoeducation, since this study showedthat ACD yields effects beyond psychoeducation. In addition, the music component hasthe ability to adjust emotional states and promote mind–body interactions and is widelyaccepted for promoting relaxation in healthcare. As an exercise with moderate intensity,dance movements may release endorphins that help people feel relaxed after exercise [
80
].
The mechanism for stress and emotional adjustment could be that the dance and music
elements might regulate states of emotions through mind-body interactions which occurdue to the effects of the released neurotransmitters making participants feel entertainedand happy [
81
–
83
]. Interoception is another critical maturational element of dance whose
effects might play a role in mood regulation and the promotion of the emotional state [
46
].
ACDs’ elements of music and body movement stimulate interoception and act as distractors
to shift a person’s attention away from negative experiences and replace them with positive
thoughts [
40
,
41
,
84
]. The group element of the dance on its own also has a positive curative
effect on the participants while moving in a circle; the therapeutic factors of the groupmight advance exchange,  universality,  instillation of hope on an individual,  activatescollective unconsciousness, corrective recapitulation and mirror reaction [
32
]. The group
effect was found to have a short-term effect on the global values which fosters socialintegration [
32
,
85
]. Another possible explanation for stress reduction in the current study is
that the ACD intervention was undertaken in the social environment [
85
]. Further studies
should purposefully examine the mediation effect of stress between dancing and depressivesymptoms. Clinically, an ACD programme (i.e., ACD plus psychoeducation) holds promiseto contribute in the management of stress, and depressive symptoms in IDPs.
This study demonstrated that psychoeducation is effective in reducing anxiety, and that
dance does not exert any additional effects. Unlike anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stressis associated with a different circuitry in the brain with diminished responsivity in the an-terior cingulate cortex [
86
].  People who have undergone a traumatic experience might
not benefit in terms of anxiety from the therapeutic mechanism employed by a dance
intervention. Further studies should clarify the effects of dance interventions on anxietyin people with traumatic experiences.
The ACD was highly feasible with high recruitment and low drop-out rates. The ac-
ceptability of the ACD in terms of attendance rate was also high.  However, the level ofsatisfaction and barriers of the ACD were not measured in this study.  Possible barriersmay include space and security.  In our study, the camp sites were highly spacious andthere were limited number of terrorist attacks during the intervention period. However,some other camp sites may not provide adequate space for group dancing. Terrorist attackscould be more often that the continuity of the programme might be hindered.  Furtherstudies should explore the level of satisfaction and barriers of ACD to be implementedin the IDPs.

4.2. Generalizability
There are several limitations to this study. First, it was not a truly randomised con-
trolled trial because of the non-random subject allocation. It is a quasi-experimental design,not a true randomised controlled trial due to the consideration of subjects’ contamina-tion in the IDP camps. Due to the non-random subjects’ allocation to the groups, it waschallenging to know how well the IDPs population were represented, limiting generalis-ability of this study to other populations with traumatic experiences outside Nigeria [
87
].
Second, the lack of balance in the baseline characteristics of the subjects could indicatethat unobserved confounders might have affected the level of confidence in the effect ofthe dance intervention, although the models were adjusted for known unbalanced co-
variates observed at baseline. The baseline scores showed higher depressive symptoms
in the intervention group compared to the control group. Sub-analysis proved that there
was a regression to the mean,  in particular with those in the intervention group who
showed a greater reduction because they were higher at baseline.  There is a risk thatthe treatment effect is overestimated by solely looking at changes in scores [
88
].  Third,
the use of a specialist, not a dance/movement therapist was adopted due to resource
constraint in Africa. We, therefore recommended the employment of a registered specialist
with experience in leading African dance for future studies. The effect could possibly be due
to the amount of attention between groups because there was no interaction in the controlgroup after psychoeducation. Without a control group of usual care, the anxiety-reducingeffects observed in the psychoeducation group might possibly be caused by other con-founding factors.  The intervention of this study was not delivered by dance therapists.Nonetheless, this protocol delivered by the dance specialist also demonstrated promisingtherapeutic effects. We adopted the “10 Stress-buster” as the psychoeducation contents.
Although the contents were developed by National Health System, its effects have not
been empirically evaluated. This study, therefore, could not confidently conclude that ACDis more superior to psychoeducation.  Therefore, in future studies, we recommend thata cluster randomised controlled trial should be employed to ensure for the comparabilitybetween groups; one more passive control group should be added to provide better under-standing of the effects between ACD and psychoeducation, as well as that efficiency andcost effectiveness of the ACD delivered by dance specialists and dance therapists shouldbe compared.4.3. Overall Evidence
Compared to psychoeducation, ACD has additional effects on depressive symptoms
and stress but not on anxiety in African IDPs with traumatic experience. ACD might bea valuable complementary intervention in health promotion because it may be more readilyacceptable to general African population.  An ACD programme (i.e., ACD in additionto psychoeducation) holds promise to contribute to the management of stress for peopleliving in IDPs with traumatic experiencess. Further studies should clarify how this ACD
programme could be generalised to other IDP camps or other healthy people in Africa.

Abstract:
Abnormal  heart  rate  variability  (HRV)  has  been  observed  in  patients  with  systemic
lupus  erythematosus  (SLE).  In  a  combined  cross-sectional  and  interventional  study  approach,
we   investigated   the   association   of   HRV   with   inflammation   and   oxidative   stress   markers,
patient-reported outcomes, and the e
ff
ect of 12 weeks of aerobic exercise in HRV. Fifty-five women
with SLE (mean age 43.5
±
14.0 years) were assigned to either aerobic exercise (
n
=
26) or usual care
(
n
=
29) in a non-randomized trial.  HRV was assessed using a heart rate monitor during 10 min,
inflammatory and oxidative stress markers were obtained, psychological stress (Perceived Stress
Scale), sleep quality (Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index), fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory),depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory), and quality of life (36-item Short-Form HealthSurvey) were also assessed. Low frequency to high frequency power (LFHF) ratio was associated with
physical fatigue (
p
=
0.019). Sample entropy was inversely associated with high-sensitivity C-reactive
protein (
p
=
0.014) and myeloperoxidase (
p
=
0.007).   There were no significant between-group
di
ff
erences in the changes in HRV derived parameters after the exercise intervention. High-sensitivity
C-reactive protein and myeloperoxidase were negatively related to sample entropy and physicalfatigue was positively related to LFHF ratio. However, an exercise intervention of 12 weeks of aerobictraining did not produce any changes in HRV derived parameters in women with SLE in comparisonto a control group.Keywords:

1. Introduction
Systemic  lupus  erythematosus  (SLE)  is  a  systemic  autoimmune  disease  with  multifactorial
etiology that predominantly a
ff
ects women [
1
]. In recent years, the diagnosis and treatment of SLE
has significantly improved [
2
], and deaths due to lupus manifestation have decreased [
3
]. However,
cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality remains one of the leading causes of death in SLE patients [
4
,
5
].

The importance of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) on cardiovascular health and prognosis
has already been reported [
6
,
7
]. In fact, the ANS plays a key role in regulating immune responses to
inflammatory stimuli [
8
]. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a noninvasive and sensitive measure of ANS
function [
9
] and is defined as the physiological variation in the duration of intervals between sinus
beats [
10
]. Autonomic dysfunction is common in autoimmune rheumatic diseases [
11
], and specifically,
increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic activity as reported by several studies in patients
with SLE [
12
–
14
].  In this sense, patients with SLE have shown abnormal HRV, a surrogate marker
of cardiac ANS dysfunction [
15
], which may predispose to the onset of fatal arrhythmias in these
patients [
16
].  Considering that HRV is inversely associated with inflammatory markers in healthy
individuals and in patients with CVD [
17
], it is of clinical interest to: (i) understand the extent to which
HRV might be associated to inflammatory markers and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and (ii)
whether HRV can be enhanced through interventions in women with SLE.
Exercise is a potential intervention that significantly increases cardiorespiratory fitness [
18
,
19
],
improves cardiovascular function and PROs (i.e., fatigue, depression, etc.) [
20
] in patients with SLE.
Although exercise has shown to decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the general
population [
21
,
22
], its benefits in SLE population are understudied to the extent that exercise hardly
appear  in  the  EULAR  guidelines  for  the  management  of  this  chronic  disease  [
23
].   Benatti  and
Pedersen [
24
] suggested that one of the mechanisms by which exercise might benefit the cardiovascular
system in patients with rheumatic diseases is through direct or indirect anti-inflammatory e
ff
ects.
Based on the e
ff
ects of exercise in the general population [
25
] and other chronic conditions [
26
,
27
],
it might be hypothesized that exercise (and particularly aerobic exercise) could also increase HRV andthus regulate the ANS in women with SLE. Although there have been some studies evaluating HRVafter an exercise stress test in this population [
28
,
29
], to the best of our knowledge, no prior research
has evaluated the e
ff
ects of an aerobic exercise program on HRV in women with SLE.
Therefore, the aims of this study are (1) to cross-sectionally explore the associations of HRV with
inflammatory markers and PROs; and (2) to analyze the e
ff
ect of a 12-week aerobic program in women
with SLE on HRV derived parameters.
2. Materials and Methods2.1. Study Design and Participants
This  study  included  data  of  58  women  with  SLE  from  a  non-randomized  controlled  trial
investigating the e
ff
ects of a 12-week aerobic exercise program on arterial sti
ff
ness, inflammation,
and  cardiorespiratory  fitness  [
19
].   Participants  were  recruited  from  the  Systemic  Autoimmune
Diseases Unit of the “Virgen de las Nieves” and “San Cecilio” University Hospitals (Granada, Spain).
A comprehensive description of the inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found elsewhere [
19
].
The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Granada (ref.   No.:  10
/
2016) and
registered at
clinicaltrials.gov
[NCT03107442] with HRV among the pre-established secondary outcomes.
All participants signed written informed consent. The baseline data were used for the cross-sectional
analyses of the present study.2.2. Intervention2.2.1. Exercise Group
The exercise program has been comprehensively described elsewhere [
19
] following the Consensus
on Exercise Reporting Template (CERT) [
30
]. Participants assigned to the exercise group performed
two 75-min sessions per week of moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic exercise on a treadmill
(BH, Serie i.RC12 Dual, Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain) for 12 weeks.  All sessions began with a warm-up
on the treadmill at about 35–40% of the heart rate reserve (HRR) plus 3–4 min of active stretching,
while ending with a cool down of static stretching and relaxation. Exercise was prescribed with training
68

, 9501
intensity progressively increasing in a range from 40% to 75% of each individual’s HRR. In all sessions,heart rate was monitored with a Polar V800 (Polar Inc., Kempele, Finland).
Only continuous exercise was performed during the first half of the program. Continuous sessions
comprised several bouts of exertion at constant intensity, followed by a couple of minutes of recovery.
At 8 weeks, continuous and interval sessions were alternated, and at 12 weeks, the patients performed
only interval training sessions, with periods of lower and higher intensity e
ff
orts followed by some
minutes of rest for hydration. The progression in volume and
/
or intensity was undertaken by increasing
the treadmill speed or inclination according to the perceived exertion of each patient. Lastly, the exerciseintensity progressions had to be slightly modified since several patients perceived a 5% HRR intensityincrease as very heavy and di
ffi
cult-to-follow. Therefore, exercise intensity increased by 2.5% instead
of 5% in some weeks.2.2.2. Control Group
SLE patients assigned to the control (usual care) group received information about a healthy
lifestyle, including physical activity guidelines and basic nutritional information.2.3. Heart Rate Variability
Participants were requested not to drink ca
ff
einated or alcoholic drinks, to fast for at least 3 h,
and not to participate in physical activity 24 h before the assessment. R-R intervals were recorded witha Polar V800 (Polar Inc., Kempele, Finland), a validated instrument [
31
], placed at the sternum level.
Participants were place in supine position in a quiet room (temperature 22–24
◦
C) between 4 p.m. and
7 p.m., and were instructed to breath normally, stay relaxed and not to speak or fidget during theassessment. HRV was recorded for 10 min, after a period of 5 min, at a sampling frequency of 1000 Hz.HRV raw data was analyzed with Kubios (HRV analysis, Finland).  After visual inspection for any
premature contractions or ectopic beats in the recording, a 5-min period was manually selected by
the evaluator. Kubios filters were applied accordingly based on inter-individual variability and if thesample presented more than 5% of interpolated R-R intervals it was discarded as per manufacturer’srecommendation [
32
].
The following HRV derived parameters were analyzed: the standard deviation of the average
normal-to-normal (NN) interval (SDNN), the square root of the mean squared di
ff
erences of successive
NN intervals (RMSSD), and percentage of consecutive R-R intervals that di
ff
er by more than 50 ms
(pNN50), low frequency power (LF: 0.04–0.15 Hz), high frequency power (HF: 0.15–0.4 Hz) and LF to
HF power ratio (LFHF) indices (which were computed using the fast Fourier transform), Poincar
é
Plot
were standard deviation 1 (SD1), represents short-term variability, and standard deviation 2 (SD2),
the long-term variability (compared with SD1); and sample entropy (SampEn).2.4. Patient-Reported Outcomes
Health-related quality of life was assessed using the short version of the Spanish version of the
36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) [
33
]. Depression was assessed through the Beck Depression
Inventory-second edition (BDI-II) [
34
]. Psychological stress was measured with the Perceived Stress
Scale (PSS) [
35
], and fatigue with the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) [
36
].
2.5. Inflammatory and Oxidative Stress Markers
Fasting blood samples for biochemical and immunological tests were collected and processed.
High-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor
α
(TNF-
α
) were measured
as  markers  of  inflammation,  whereas  myeloperoxidase  (MPO)  was  determined  as  a  marker  ofoxidative stress.

2.6. Other Measurements
Height was measured using a height gauge, weight with a bioimpedance device (InBody R20,
Korea), and body mass index (BMI) was calculated (kg
/
m
2
).  Blood pressure was measured with
Mobil-O-Graph
®
(IEM GmbH, Stolberg, Germany) [
37
]. Disease activity was assessed through the
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI) [
38
]. Physical activity was
self-reported with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire [
39
]. All participants filled out a
socio-demographic and clinical data questionnaire.2.7. Classification of Responders, Non-Responders, and Adverse Responders
The inter-individual variability of the patients in the response to the intervention was analyzed
by categorizing participants from each group as responders, non-responders or adverse respondersusing the typical error measurement (TE). The TE was calculated using the equation TE
=
SDdi
ff/
√
2,
where SDdi
ff
is the standard deviation of the di
ff
erence scores observed between the 2 repeats of
each measurement [
40
].  A responder was defined as an individual who demonstrated an increase
(in favor of beneficial changes), an adverse responder was defined as an individual who demonstrated
a decrease, and a non-responder was defined as an individual who failed to demonstrate an increaseor decrease that was
>
2 times the TE away from 0. A change more than 2 times the TE means that this
response is a true physiological adaptation beyond what might be expected to result from technicaland
/
or biological variability [
41
].
2.8. Treatment Allocation and Blinding
Randomization was not possible as many participants lived far and were not able to attend the
exercise sessions in case of being randomized to exercise.  Therefore, participants from the city ofGranada were included in the exercise group and participants living outside Granada were included inthe control group. To minimize potential selection bias, we aimed to match the groups by age (
±
2 years),
BMI (
±
1kg
/
m
2
), and SLEDAI (
±
1 unit). The data analyzer was blinded to the patient allocation.
2.9. Statistical Analysis
Normality was tested using visual inspection of histograms and Q-Q plots.  As HRV-derived
parameters were non-normally distributed, their descriptive analysis was presented using median and
interquartile range, while non-parametric test was used for the main analysis. Between-group baseline
characteristics were compared with the Student t-test (when normally distributed), Kruskal–Wallistest (when non-normally distributed) for continuous variables and the Chi-square test for categorical
variables. To explore the associations of HRV with inflammatory and oxidative stress markers (hsCRP,
IL-6, TNF-
α
and MPO) and PROs (aim 1), scatter plots and Spearman’s bivariate correlations were used
as preliminary analyses to understand raw associations.  Subsequently, quantile regression models
were built, including each of the above HRV parameters as dependent variables and each inflammatory
marker as independent variables in regression models along with age, heart rate, and disease durationas relevant factors that might confound the association of interest. This same procedure was followed
with PROs. Other variables included in the regression model were SLEDAI, systemic damage index
(SDI), and smoking. However, neither of these variables a
ff
ected the regression coe
ffi
cients; therefore,
they were not included. Inflammatory markers (hsCRP, IL-6 and TNF–
α
) and MPO were winsorized
to the highest value due to the presence of outliers.
To assess the effects of the exercise intervention (aim 2), the between group differences in the change
from baseline in HRV-derived parameters were assessed through quantile regression with baseline values,heart rate, and age as covariables. As we aimed at assessing efficacy, the primary analyses were defined as
per-protocol, where patients from the exercise group were included if attendance to the exercise sessions
was
≥
75%.  We additionally performed sensitivity analyses including (i) participants with attendance
70

≥
90%; and (ii) baseline observation carried forward (BOCF). All the analyses were conducted with SPSS
v.26 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical significance was set at
p
<
0.05.

3.1. Associations of HRV with Inflammatory, Oxidative Stress Markers, and PROs (Aim 1)
The raw association of the HRV parameters with inflammatory markers and PROs is presented
in abbreviated form in Table

p
<

parameter with inflammatory markers. Regarding PROs, LFHF ratio was positively correlated with the
Physical Fatigue dimension of the MFI (r

The HRV signals from 5 participants from the control group were excluded due to excessive
interpolated beats (
>
5%). Full HRV data at baseline and week 12 was obtained from 44 participants
(21 exercise and 23 control). The primary analyses revealed no significant between-group di

erences
between changes in HRV derived parameters (Table

) in all domains, and these results were consistent
in  sensitivity  analyses  in  which  participants  from  the  exercise  group  were  included  only  whenattendance of the exercise sessions was
≥
90% (Table S2) and in BOCF analyses (Table S3).

4. Discussion
Our cross-sectional analyses revealed that, among the studied HRV-related variables, sample
entropy was inversely associated with hsCRP and MPO and that low frequency and high frequencyratio was directly associated with physical fatigue in women with SLE. The secondary analyses ofour clinical trial revealed that 12 weeks of progressive aerobic training did not change HRV-derived
parameters in comparison to a control group of SLE patients who received recommendations for a
healthy lifestyle.
Imbalance in the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the ANS are associated with
increased risk of inflammation [
8
] which could lead to higher cardiovascular risk [
41
]. In our study,
we  observed  that  higher  values  of  hsCRP  and  MPO  were  associated  with  decreased  regularity
(SampleEn) but not with any other HRV parameter. Elevated hsCRP and MPO levels have been shown
to be increased in this population and associated with inflammation [
42
].  In addition, MPO and
hsCRP accurately predicted cardiovascular mortality risk and risk assessment in coronary angiography
patients [
43
]. Several inflammatory pathways seem to be involved in the relationship with HRV. One of
the possible explanations could be changes in the activity of the vagal system that modulates theinflammatory response significantly, which can be blocked or enhanced by transmitter substances
(i.e., noradrenaline) or by pro-inflammatory cytokines [
44
]. A decrease in regularity (SampleEn) could
be related to the idea proposed by Goldberger et al. [
45
], in which nonlinear complexity breaks down
with aging and disease reducing the individual’s adaptive capabilities.  We also found a positive
correlation between HRV and IL-6 but not with TNF-
α
.   After adjusting the quantile regression
model by age, heart rate, and disease duration we did not find an association between HRV and IL-6.However, it should be noted that both inflammatory markers and ANS have a circadian variationand that the explanatory power of correlating HRV activity and inflammation may be limited by thetime frame of the analysis [
46
]. Given that our HRV data were collected in the afternoon and once at
baseline and after the intervention, this could a
ff
ect our conclusions about these associations.
Regarding PROs, we did not find in our sample associations between HRV and depression, stress
or health-related quality of life as previously reported [
47
].  However, we observed an association
between HRV and physical fatigue, as previous findings in other illnesses such as breast cancer [
48
].
According to Pagani et al. [
49
], slow autonomic responses to environmental demands or an imbalance
between sympathetic and parasympathetic branches may contribute to reduced physical activity,and increased fatigue. It is important to note that fatigue improvements have been described in SLEindependently of changes in fitness levels and that fatigue is a multifaceted phenomenon that might bea
ff
ected by di
ff
erent peripheral and central mechanisms [
50
]. However, we have observed reductions
76

IJERPH
2020
,
17
, 9501
in general fatigue after our exercise intervention with cardiorespiratory fitness as a mediator [
20
],
which could be related to a better conditioning in these patients.
To the best of our knowledge, no prior research has evaluated the e
ff
ects of aerobic exercise on
HRV in women with SLE. Yorgun et al. [
28
] studied HRV during 24 h in SLE patients and controls after
an exercise stress test finding a higher QT dispersion, along the lines of previous work by Rivera-L
ó
pez
et al. [
51
], and impairments in the autonomic cardiac function in SLE patients compared to controls.
A similar study was performed by Bienias et al. [
29
] controlling the e
ff
ect of beta-blockers in one of
the groups, concluding that impaired heart rate recovery was associated with disease duration andbeta-blocker treatment. Our results showed no di
ff
erences in HRV between groups after an aerobic
exercise program.  However, as shown in Figure
2
, there are some participants that improved their
RMSDD after the intervention and, compared to the control group, all participants slightly improvedas well even if these di
ff
erences were not significant.  It is important to note that our sample size
is small, and we had dropout patients in both groups, although our results were consistent acrossdi
ff
erent sensitivity analyses (Tables S2 and S3). This show that, although our intervention improved
CRF in these patients [
19
], it was not as e
ff
ective in other secondary parameters such as HRV. Therefore,
a more e
ff
ective or intense intervention program could have had improvements in HRV and other
physiological parameters.  In fact, HRV as a tool to guide daily training has shown to be superior
(at increasing fitness and exercise performance) to other training conventional methods [
52
].
This study has limitations.   First,  since our sample size was relatively small,  and this study
is exploratory and hypotheses-generating in nature, we did not perform corrections for multiple
comparisons, which would likely eliminate all the observed associations. Future studies with largersamples should confirm or contrast these findings. Second, only women with mild
/
inactive disease
were included. Therefore, the results are not generalizable to men or even women with medium–high
disease. Third, this study comes from the secondary analysis of a non-randomized design, and, despitestatistical adjustment, residual confounding cannot be discarded. Four, we did not have a group ofhealthy subjects performing the exercise program, which would have enabled us to compare the results.However, the study also has some strengths that must be highlighted. First, to our knowledge this isthe most comprehensive study done about HRV in women with SLE. Second, we have shown howeveryone responded individually to the exercise program based on their HRV.5. Conclusions
Our study suggests that increases in hsCRP and MPO are related to decreased regularity, and that
physical fatigue seems to be related to HRV in women with SLE. Additionally, 12 weeks of progressive
aerobic training (75 min twice a week) did not produce any changes in HRV derived parameterscompared to a usual care control group in women with mild
/
inactive disease. Future clinical trials with
larger sample sizes and a di
ff
erent training program or with higher intensity are needed to enhance
our understanding on how HRV could help monitor inflammation in this population; and how theyrespond to an exercise intervention using HRV as a guideline to prescribe training on a day-to-day basis.Supplementary Materials:

1. Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a significant public health issue, as it is the leading cause of adult
mortality, accounting for more than 40% of deaths in China [
1
]. Over the past 30 years, the number
of CVD deaths in China has increased from 2.51 million to 3.97 million annually [
2
].  Although the
age-standardized mortality rate remained stable overall from 2002 to 2016, it increased among the
young population [
3
]. Therefore, the early prevention of CVD is essential [
4
].
The  risk  factors  of  CVD  include  dyslipidemia,  diabetes,  and  obesity  [
5
].    In  recent  years,
hyperuricemia has also been recognized as a potential risk factor for CVD, following the discovery
of a causal relationship between uric acid and the adverse outcomes of CVD [
6
,
7
]. Among the many
risk factors, obesity a
ff
ects cardiovascular disease in several ways; for instance, obesity a
ff
ects the
morbidity of CVD, and early obesity may increase the risk of future CVD events [
8
].  Obesity also
a
ff
ects the prognosis of CVD. A meta-analysis showed that overweight and obese individuals had
25% and 42% increased risks of CVD mortality, respectively, compared to those of normal-weight
individuals [
9
]. Furthermore, the duration of obesity may also a
ff
ect CVD. Abdullah et al. [
10
] found
that every two years of obese living significantly increased the risk of CVD mortality by 7%. This mayIJERPH

be because obesity worsens other CVD risk factors such as blood lipid and blood glucose levels [
11
].
It is necessary, therefore, to assess the risk factors of CVD in overweight and obese individuals.
Common measures of obesity include body mass index (BMI) and body composition.  Body
composition is one of the components of health-related physical fitness (HPF). In addition to body
composition, other HPF components include cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular fitness, and flexibility.HPF reflects not only the ability of the body to participate in exercise, but also the body’s abilityto reduce the risk of disease.  HPF assessment, therefore, may have important implications in the
prevention of chronic diseases. Previous studies have shown that HPF can predict multiple risk factors
for CVD [
12
–
14
].  Body composition is better at distinguishing between fat mass and fat-free mass
than BMI. Studies have shown that individuals with the same BMI may di
ff
er in body composition,
which a
ff
ects their risks of CVD [
15
].  Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is one of the most important
HPF factors, and it is a strong predictor of CVD [
16
,
17
]. The respiratory function, however, also plays
an important role in cardiovascular health [
18
], and it is not clear whether indicators of respiratory
function can be used to assess the risk of CVD. In recent years, the relationship between muscularfitness and CVD has gradually attracted attention.  Grip strength has a negative correlation with
triglyceride and glucose levels [
19
], and decreased respiratory muscle strength is an independent risk
factor for CVD [
20
]. The relationship between muscle strength and uric acid level may vary between
populations. One study reported a negative correlation between grip strength and uric acid in youngpeople but a positive correlation in older people [
21
].  Flexibility may also be an indicator of CVD
risk. Chang et al. found that flexibility was positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein levelsamong 628 community residents but did not control other variables such as sex and age [
22
]. Thus,
the relationship between flexibility and CVD requires further exploration.
To the best of our knowledge, numerous studies have been conducted on the relationship between
HPF and CVD in normal-weight individuals [
13
,
22
]. No study, however, has focused on overweight
and obese university sta
ff
.  A cross-sectional study found that 94 percent of university sta
ff
were
exposed to one or more CVD risk factors [
23
]. This may indicate that university sta
ff
have a higher risk
of cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, university sta
ff
have a higher prevalence of overweight and
obesity than the general population does because of longer working hours and psychosocial factors [
24
].
Cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as blood lipids, glucose, and uric acid levels, may further
worsen among university sta
ff
in overweight and obese states. The purpose of this study, therefore,
was to explore the associations between HPF and CVD risk factors in overweight and obese university
sta
ff
and to provide a basis for HPF testing in evaluating the risk of CVD and the development of
future exercise intervention strategies.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Participants and Study Design
From October 2019 to January 2020, a total of 2800 university sta
ff
underwent annual health
screenings at the Community Hospital Health Management Center. This cross-sectional study recruiteduniversity sta
ff
every morning in the breakfast serving area of the Health Management Center. A sample
size of 319 was required to achieve 90% statistical power based on the calculation of PASS.11.0, and412 university sta
ff
were actually recruited.  Among the 412 participants, 38 participants did not
complete HPF tests, and 34 participants were over 60 years.  A total of 340 overweight and obeseuniversity sta
ff
aged between 25 and 60, with a BMI greater than 24.0, were eventually included in the
study.  The classification criteria for overweight and obesity were from the China Obesity WorkingGroup [
25
].
Participants first underwent a blood collection procedure, and then height, weight, and body
composition  were  measured.    Other  HPF  tests  were  performed  after  participants  ate  breakfastand  took  a  15  min  break  to  regain  their  strength.    The  participants  were  informed  of  the  test
procedures, requirements, and possible risks before the test, and they signed the informed consent

forms. The protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of Shaanxi Normal University, and theethical approval code is 202016003.2.2. Study Variables2.2.1. Health-Related Physical Fitness Measurement
Health-related physical fitness indicators were measured by trained research assistants according
to the National Physical Fitness Standards Manual.
Body height and weight were measured using an all-in-one machine (GK 720, Shandong, China),
which combined an ultrasonic stadiometer with an electronic weight scale. The machine was calibrated
before each use to ensure accuracy. Participants stood barefoot in a designated position and lookedstraight ahead. The test results were automatically recorded and reported.
Body composition was assessed with a bioelectrical impedance machine (InBody 230, Seoul, South
Korea). Participants stood barefoot on the electrodes of the machine and held the handles with bothhands. Participants remained in a natural standing position throughout the test and always kept theirhands and feet in contact with the electrodes. The test program took 1 to 2 min, and skeletal musclemass (SMM) and total body fat mass (BFM) were automatically recorded by the InBody 230. Skeletalmuscle mass index (SMI) was determined using SMM divided by height squared. Body fat percentage
(BFP) was determined using BFM divided by body weight.
Grip   strength   was   measured   using   a   portable   electronic   grip   strength   dynamometer
(Hengkangjiaye, Guangzhou, China). Participants stood naturally with their arms slanting down and
their palms inward.  Participants were not allowed to swing their arms or hold the dynamometerclose to their bodies during the test.  Each hand was tested twice, and the highest measurements
were recorded.
Flexibility was assessed with the sit-and-reach test (SRT). An electronic fleximeter (HKD-1442,
Beijing, China) was used to achieve better accuracy. Participants sat barefoot in the required position
with their legs straight and their feet together. During each measurement, participants pushed their
feet against the front ba
ffl
e and stretched their arms as far forward as possible. Measurements were
recorded to evaluate flexibility as participants tried to push the cursor on the farthest scale with thefingertips of their hands. Participants tried three times, and the largest measurements were recorded.
Vital capacity (VC) was measured using an electronic pneumometer (WCS-1000, Beijing, China).
Participants inhaled deeply and then exhaled all the air to assess vital capacity.  Participants triedthis three times, and the maximum exhalation was recorded. Participants were asked to rest 30–60 sbetween the three measurements in order to avoid hypoxia. Vital capacity Index (VCI) was determinedusing VC divided by body weight.2.2.2. Cardiovascular Disease Factors Measurement
After a night of fasting, blood samples were collected from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. in the Community
Hospital Health Management Center. On the same day, blood specimens were processed and analyzedin the laboratory of the Community Hospital.  The automatic analyzer AU480 (Beckman Coulter,California, USA) was used to analyze blood biochemistry. Serum uric acid (UA), triglycerides (TG), totalcholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(LDL-C) were measured with enzymatic methods.   Blood glucose (GLU) was measured using a
hexokinase enzymatic method. TG
/
HDL-C was, thereafter, used to estimate insulin resistance [
26
].
2.3. Statistical Analysis
All variables were checked for normality using the Kolmogorov

Smirnov test.   Continuous
variables with normal distribution were presented by mean
±
standard deviation (SD), continuous
variables with non-normal distribution were presented by median (interquartile range (IQR)), and
categorical variables were presented by number (percentage). Multiple linear regression was used to

4. Discussion
This study evaluated the associations between HPF indicators and CVD risk factors in overweight
and obese university sta
ff
. The main findings of this study were that reduced flexibility was associated
with elevated GLU level,  while high body fat percentage,  muscle mass,  and grip strength were
associated with high UA level.  We also observed that grip strength was positively associated withhigh-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol  (HDL-C)  level  and  that  body  fat  percentage  was  positively
associated with TG and TG
/
HDL-C levels. These results indicated that the HPF and CVD risk factors
were related, and they provide a basis for nonmedical evaluations of CVD risk in overweight or obese
university sta
ff
and the development of future exercise intervention strategies.
Our analysis of the association between HPF indicators and UA showed that body fat percentage
was positively associated with UA level. This may be attributed to the fact that purine metabolism
in adipose tissue is enhanced in obesity [
27
,
28
].  Furthermore, the distribution of body fat is closely
related to UA level [
29
].  Huang et al.  reported that visceral fat accumulation increased the risk of
hyperuricemia in older Chinese adults [
30
]. This finding suggests that, in addition to the total body fat
85

IJERPH
2020
,
17
, 9031
percentage, visceral fat is also an important indicator to consider in the prevention of hyperuricemia.
We also observed that skeletal muscle index and grip strength were positively associated with UA
level. This finding is consistent with those of previous cross-sectional studies in the elderly [
31
–
33
].
UA is the final product of purine metabolism. An excessive accumulation of UA in the body may causenot only gout but also heart failure [
6
,
7
]. In recent years, UA has been observed to slow age-related
muscle decline [
33
,
34
]. In a longitudinal study, Macchi et al. [
35
] found that in people with an average
age of 76 years, higher baseline serum UA levels were associated with better muscle function three
years later. This muscular protection, however, was not observed in those under 60 years of age [
36
].
Furthermore, the possible physiological mechanisms by which UA protects muscles are not clear.
Although studies have assumed that UA plays a protective role in the process of free radical damage to
skeletal muscle protein [
37
], UA is also a pro-oxidant and may increase oxidative stress. Another study
suggests that UA may be an indicator of dietary protein intake. High UA concentrations in patients
with hyperuricemia are associated with better nutritional status [
38
]. Total protein intake, particularly
those of meat and fish proteins, may be important for building and maintaining muscle mass [
39
].
Individuals with higher dietary protein intake, therefore, may maintain higher muscle mass as wellas higher UA levels. Previous studies have shown that high body fat and muscle mass both place aburden on the cardiovascular system and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease [
11
], indicating
that weight control and improvement to body composition are important for overweight and obeseuniversity sta
ff
.
Our study results revealed that flexibility was negatively associated with GLU level. Aparicio
et al. [
40
] also reported a negative correlation between flexibility and GLU in menopausal women;
however, their finding was not statistically significant, probably because flexibility was a self-reportedscale  score  rather  than  an  actual  measured  value.   One  possible  explanation  for  the  associationbetween flexibility and GLU is disc degeneration. Hyperglycemia has a detrimental e
ff
ect on disc cell
viability, leading to disc degeneration and impaired lumbar flexibility [
41
]. Inflammatory cytokines,
which mediate insulin resistance,  also play a role in disc degeneration [
42
,
43
].   The relationship
between flexibility and GLU metabolism, however, remains poorly understood, and as many factorsa
ff
ecting flexibility and blood glucose are not considered, the exact mechanism is not clear. Studies
in recent years have begun to recognize the value of flexibility in evaluating and preventing chronicdiseases.   Gregorio et al. [
44
] reported that flexibility not only in the waist but also in the upper
body is associated with cardiometabolic risk factors.  Another study found that flexibility exercises
reduced pro-inflammatory adipokines, such as PAI-1 and chemerin, and increased anti-inflammatoryadipokines, such as adiponectin [
45
]. Future studies are needed to further confirm the e
ff
ectiveness of
flexibility training in reducing blood glucose and preventing CVD.
Our analysis of the relationship between HPF and blood lipids revealed that body fat percentage
was positively associated with TG and TG
/
HDL-C levels. This finding is supported by previous studies
using dual-energy X-rays and confirmed that body fat and its distribution are closely related to bloodlipid levels [
46
,
47
]. Konieczna et al. [
46
] further compared regional and total body fat measurements,
reporting that the ratio of visceral adipose tissue to total fat was a more e
ff
ective evaluation indicator
of TG. This may be because visceral fat mediates partial insulin resistance through the release ofinflammatory adipokines [
46
].  As a result, lipolysis is intensified, and excess TGs enter the liver,
causing an abnormally high TG level [
48
].
We observed that grip strength was positively associated with HDL-C level. Grip strength is an
e
ff
ective indicator of muscle strength and of potential health risks [
49
]. In a study of 8576 participants,
Lee et al.  found that participants with low grip strength had increased risks of CVD [
50
].  Another
large sample study determined that higher relative grip strength was associated with healthier bloodlipid levels in adults, such as lower TG and total cholesterol levels and higher HDL-C levels [
19
].
This  may  be  related  to  the  endocrine  function  of  skeletal  muscle  and  its  metabolic  benefits  [
51
].
Cytokines secreted by the muscles may regulate the metabolic process through autocrine and paracrine
86

IJERPH
2020
,
17
, 9031
mechanisms. Cytokines, such as myonectin and irisin, regulate lipid metabolism and improve insulinresistance [
52
,
53
].
One advantage of this study was that we first explored the associations between HPF and CVD
risk factors in overweight or obese adults and provided new insight regarding CVD prevention andcontrol strategies. Secondly, the HPF indicators included in this study were easy to measure and obtain.It is convenient, therefore, for the general population to conduct HPF self-assessments.  Certainly,this study also has some limitations.  Firstly, physical activity, nutritional status, and physiologicalindicators related to inflammation, such as blood pressure and CRP, were not included in the study.Secondly, our study cannot determine the causal relationship between HPF and CVD risk factorsdue to the cross-sectional design.  Thirdly, the results of this study cannot be generalized for theoverall population, as participants were overweight and obese adults. In the future, longitudinal orexperimental studies should be considered to verify the causal relationship between HPF and CVDrisk factors.5. Conclusions
Among overweight and obese university sta
ff
, reduced flexibility was associated with high glucose
level, while high body fat percentage, muscle mass, and grip strength were associated with high uricacid level.  Additionally, grip strength was positively associated with HDL-C level, and body fat
percentage was positively associated with TG and TG
/
HDL-C levels. The results of this study suggest
that body composition, grip strength, and flexibility may be practical nonmedical markers for assessingcardiovascular disease risk. In the future, prospective studies should be conducted to investigate theextent to which exercise programs that improve body composition and increase muscle strength andflexibility may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Abstract:
The literature is uncertain about the extent to which those who attend cardiac rehabilitation
(CR)  gain  weight  while  trying  to  quit  smoking.   This  study  aimed  to  determine  the  extent  of
CR-based smoking cessation provision and whether CR, as delivered in routine practice, is associated
with helping patients quit smoking and avoid weight gain.  Data from the UK National Audit of
Cardiac Rehabilitation database, between April 2013 and March 2016, were used. Smoking status iscategorised as smokers and quitters assessed by patient self-report. Outcomes included body weight,blood pressure, depression, and physical activity. A multiple linear regression model was constructedto understand the e
ff
ect of continuing smoking or quitting smoking on CR outcomes. CR outcome
scores  were  adjusted  by  the  baseline  CR  score  for  each  characteristic.    An  e-survey  collectedinformation  about  the  smoking  cessation  support  o
ff
ered  to  patients  attending  CR.  A  total  of
2052 smokers (
58.59
±
10.49 years
, 73.6% male) and 1238 quitters (57.63
±
10.36 years, 75.8% male)
were analysed.   Overall,  92.6% of CR programmes in the United Kingdom (UK) o

cessation support for CR attenders. Quitting smoking during CR was associated with a mean increasein body weight of 0.4 kg, which is much less than seen in systematic reviews. Quitters who attendedCR also had better improvements in physical activity status and psychosocial health measuresthan smokers. As delivered in routine practice, CR programmes in the UK adhere to the guidelinerecommendations for smoking cessation interventions, help patients quit smoking, and avoid weightgain on completion of CR.Keywords:

1. Introduction
Smoking is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the cause of death for approximately
8 million people annually [
1
].  For developing non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular,
cancers, and respiratory diseases, smoking is considered a preventable risk factor [
2
].
A meta-analysis by Aubin et al. of 62 clinical trials that described weight gain in smokers who
quit smoking for up to 12 months suggests that body weight increased on average by 1.12 kg, 2.26 kg,
2.85 kg, 4.23 kg, and 4.67 kg at one, two, three, six, and 12 months, respectively, after quitting [
3
].
Most of the weight gain occurs within three months of quitting, and estimates of weight gain were
similar among smokers using di
ff
erent pharmacotherapies to support smoking cessation [
3
].
A large systematic review and meta-analysis of 35 prospective cohort studies with 63,403 quitters
and 388,432 continuing smokers looking at the association between smoking cessation and weightgain found that quitting smoking was associated with a mean weight gain of 4.10 kg and meanbody mass index (BMI) gain of 1.14 kg
/
m
2
over an average of 5 years [
4
].  The participants in this
meta-analysis were similar to the general population in contrast to participants in the meta-analysisby
Aubin et al. [
3
]
, making their findings more generalisable.  In addition, the cohort studies in the
meta-analysis  by
Tian et al. [
4
]
had  longer  follow-up  periods  than  those  in  the  meta-analyses  by

Aubin et al. [

]
, which allows for an assessment of the e
ff
ects of quitting smoking on weight change
beyond 12 months.
The cross-sectional studies of the four EUROASPIRE surveys, which took place between 1999
and 2013, investigated characteristics of successful quitters who had been pre-event smokers andreported a non-smoking status at the time of interview (median 1.2 years [range 0.5 to 3 years]) [
5
].
They also found that smoking cessation was associated with weight gain [
5
]. Numerous cohort studies
have shown that people who stop smoking gain weight [
6
–
12
].
Gaining weight while stopping smoking can lead to anxiety and depression. Systematic reviews
and meta-analyses found that overweight, obesity, and depression interacted reciprocally and thatoverweight and obesity increased the risk for anxiety and depression [
13
–
15
].
Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a structured,  multi-disciplinary intervention that is o
ff
ered to
patients with CVD with the goal of reducing risk factors (smoking) and promoting psychosocial
wellbeing [
16
–
18
].  Positive health outcomes, such as a reduction in cardiovascular mortality and
hospital readmission, have been associated with CR participation [
19
,
20
]. In the United Kingdom (UK),
patients with CVD have access to CR programmes. Programme uptake in the UK averages 50% and
is considered one of the highest uptake figures compared to other countries [
21
].  CR programmes
are delivered to the British Association for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation (BACPR)standards  with  the  goal  of  reducing  cardiovascular  risk  and  promoting  quality  of  life  through
coordinated core components of CVD prevention and rehabilitation [
17
]. Recommendations include
providing smoking cessation support and relapse prevention through lifestyle risk factor management
as one of its core components [
17
]. On average, 94% of individuals who join CR programmes in the UK
are classified as non-smokers [
21
]. The average increase in smoking cessation among individuals who
participate in CR is approximately one percent (1.1%) [
21
].
A key aim of CR and a goal for most patients is to bring the body mass index (BMI) below
<
30  kg
/
m
2
[
17
].   On  average,  30%  of  patients  in  the  UK  started  CR  with  a  BMI
>
30  kg
/
m
2
[
21
].
The contribution of CR to reducing BMI at a national level is low, with an average change of 0.2% in
patients with BMI
<
30 kg
/
m
2
after CR [
21
]. This highlights the di
ffi
culty in addressing this risk factor.
Additional factors need to be taken into account before drawing conclusions about how well CR
programmes support weight management. Although smoking cessation results in considerable health
improvements, it is often accompanied by weight gain, with patients who are trying to quit smokingmore likely to put on 3–5 kg of weight in the first three months to a year [
3
]. Although weight gain
does not o
ff
set the health benefits of smoking cessation, which far exceed any health risks that may
result from smoking cessation-induced weight gain, it is frequently a source of concern for smokers
planning to quit [
7
]. This substantial e
ff
ect may inhibit the reporting of some successful weight loss
programmes.  The link between smoking and body weight is closely related and poses significant
challenges for researchers investigating intervention e
ff
ects in smokers.  The most recent Cochrane
review of 24 trials with a total of 7279 adult participants investigated the e
ff
ectiveness of exercise-based
interventions alone, or combined with a smoking cessation programmes and concluded no significante
ff
ect from adding exercise to smoking cessation [
22
].   The same authors do state and concludes
that  more  studies  are  needed  and  that  future  trials  may  alter  these  conclusions  [
22
].   Moreover,
new research published in the British Journal of Pharmacology has confirmed that exercise can helpsmokers quit smoking and may aid smoking cessation by reducing the severity of smoking withdrawalsymptoms [
23
]. As weight gain may be a barrier to quitting smoking or a reason to restart smoking,
CR has not been evaluated in relation to weight gain after smoking cessation. As weight gain may bea barrier against quitting smoking, it is important to investigate smoking cessation support services
provided in CR to help patients quit smoking while maintaining their weight status. Little is known
about how routinely delivered CR programmes support smoking cessation.
This study determines the extent of CR-based smoking cessation provision and whether CR,
as delivered in routine practice, is associated with helping patients quit smoking and avoid weight gain.

2. Materials and Methods2.1. Data Source
Individual, patient-level data from the National Audit of Cardiac Rehabilitation (NACR) were
used in the analyses of this study. The NACR, funded by the British Heart Foundation, is a web-basedregistry of CR in the UK. Data on patients who are eligible or referred to CR delivery are entered by
practitioners into an electronic patient dataset according to a data dictionary (
www.cardiacrehabilitation.
org.uk
/
nacr
/
downloads.htm
). The NACR team checks data quality from clinical teams who directly
enters data into a secure online system (hosted by NHS Digital) who then provide NACR withanonymized local programme-level data. The NACR includes details of a patient’s initiating event,treatment type, risk factors, drugs, patient demographics, and post-CR clinical outcomes. Anonymiseddata is collected for a range of clinical indicators for the purposes of audit and research under Section251 of the NHS Act 2006 [
21
]. NHS Digital annually reviews data governance and approval for NACR
projects that aim to improve service quality and patient outcomes. Separate approval for this study
in addition to the e-survey project was not required, as it was considered part of the NACR qualityand outcomes process. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
(STROBE) guidelines were used for reporting this observational study [
24
].
2.2. Participants
Participants included in this study were from the research cohort added to the NACR database
between 1 April 2013 and 31 March 2016.  Data has been validated and extracted retrospectivelyand there were no exclusion criteria. Analyses included patient sociodemographic data and clinicalcharacteristics of individuals who started a CR programme with both a baseline and follow-up smokingstatus assessments.2.3. Smoking Outcome Measures
Smoking status is assessed via self-reported questionnaires in the NACR database [
21
]. Pre- and
post-CR smoking status is categorised into one of the following: never smoked, ex-smoker, stopped
smoking since the event, or current smoking. For the purposes of this study, patients were categorisedas continued smokers (defined as current smokers in pre- and post-CR assessments) or quitters (definedas current smokers in pre- and no smoking status in post-CR assessment).
A range of patient-level variables collected by the NACR primary dataset were used for the
present study. Variables included anthropometric data, physical, and psychosocial health measures.
Anthropometric measures included weight (kg), height (m), body mass index (BMI) (kg
/
m
2
), and waist
circumference (cm).  Alcohol consumption status was measured using self-reported questionnairesrelated to weekly alcohol consumption.   Physical activity was self-reported and categorised intomoderate  physical  activity  (150  min
/
week;  yes
/
no)  or  vigorous  physical  activity  (75  min
/
week;
yes
/
no)) using the Chief Medical O
ffi
cer’s Physical Activity Questionnaire [
25
].   Physical activity
recommendations were based on the Department of Health guidelines for 19–64 and 65
+
age groups.
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a reliable and well-validated scale, was used to
assess psychosocial health status. Higher HADS scores represent worse symptoms.2.4. e-Survey
With the knowledge that smoking cessation is a key part of secondary prevention and rehabilitation
and is included in the BACPR core components of lifestyle risk factor management [
17
], a cross-sectional
11-item e-survey was sent to CR services to explore smoking cessation services provided by CR
programmes in the UK. The sampling frame encompassed the ‘coordinators’ of the 224 CR programmes
in the UK that electronically enter their data into the NACR. Several reminders were sent out via emailover two months. Data collection took place in the summer of 2016 (May 2016–July 2016). The response
rate was 78% (175
/
224 CR programmes registered in the NACR).

2.5. Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed in the IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software
statistics Version 24 (New York, NY, USA). A
p
-value
<
0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Percentage or relative change was used to measure the di
ff
erence in outcome (post-CR) from
baseline (pre-CR) [
26
,
27
]. It was calculated by: (percentage change
=
pre-CR value
−
post-CR value
/
pre-CR value) * 100
Outliers were detected by the median plus or minus 3 times the median absolute deviation
(
3
±
MAD
) method [
28
]. Pre-and post-CR values with more than 3
±
MAD percentage change for each
characteristic were eliminated from the analysis.
A multiple linear regression model was constructed to understand the e
ff
ect of continuing smoking
or quitting smoking on CR outcomes, with adjustments for the outcome CR score by the baselineCR score for each characteristic.  Post-CR outcomes (with respect to baseline) were introduced intomultiple linear regression models (as continuous dependent variables) and tested against smokingstatus (a score of 0 was categorised as a smoker, whereas a score of 1 was categorised as a quitter).
We compared and described analyses of CR patients using the original data with analyses of all data
after replacing missing values, which were handled through the expectation maximisation method [
29
].
Use of expectation maximisation to handle missing data gave similar results to the original analyses.Commonly used descriptive statistical parameters, including the number of programmes, percentages,means or medians, and standard deviations, were used to explore the data.3. Results3.1. Cohort Characteristics
A  total  of  49,725  patients  had  a  pre-  and  post-CR  smoking  status  recorded.   Non-smokers
comprised 93.4% of the sample (mean age 65.72
±
11.08 years, 74.7% male), while 4.1% of the sample
were classified as continued smokers (mean age 58.59
±
10.49 years, 73.6% male) and 2.5% were quitters
(mean age 57.63
±
10.36 years, 75.8% male). The median duration of CR was 9 weeks. For the purposes
of this research, patients were categorised as continued smokers or quitters (Table
1
).

After controlling for baseline characteristics, predictions were made to determine outcome changes
for patients who quit smoking while attending CR. Only CR patients with pre- and post-CR values
were included in the analysis after excluding pre- and post-values with percentage change more
than 3
±
MAD.
A multiple regression model was constructed to understand the e
ff
ect of quitting smoking on CR
outcomes with adjustments for the outcome CR score by the baseline CR score for each characteristic
(Table
3
). Moreover, post-CR outcomes (with respect to baseline) were introduced into multiple linear
regression models (as continuous dependent variables) and tested against smoking status (score 0 forsmokers; score 1 for quitters).

3.3. e-Survey
Overall, 175 CR programmes participated—a response rate of 78% (175
/
224 CR programmes
registered in the NACR). The following results present an overview of the survey results (Figure
1
).
Figure 1.
Number  of  cardiac  rehabilitation  programmes  providing  stopping  smoking  support.
CR: cardiac rehabilitation;  Internal:  delivering the smoking cessation support services at the CR
programme site; External: external referral.
Most CR programmes in the UK o
ff
ered smoking cessation support for CR attenders: 162 (92.6%)
programmes, while 13 (7.4%) of CR programmes did not provide patients with support to stop smoking.
About half of CR programmes (87 (49.7%) programmes) o
ff
ered both internal and external smoking
cessation support for CR attenders. Six CR programmes only o
ff
ered internal support, by delivering
smoking cessation support services at the CR programme sites, while 69 (39.4%) CR programmes onlyo
ff
ered external referrals.
Notably,  72
/
93 (77.4%) CR programmes that delivered smoking cessation support at the CR
programme  sites  (internal  delivery:   6  only  internal
+
87  both
=
93  internal)  o
ff
ered  one-to-one
sessions. On the other hand, 41 (44.1%) CR programmes o
ff
ered group education support as a form of
internal support.
Eighty four (90.3%) CR programmes that o
ff
ered smoking cessation support delivered it internally
through the CR team.  On the other hand, 30 (32.3%) CR programmes delivered smoking cessationsupport through other qualified sta
ff
members.
Sixty (38.5%) CR programmes that o
ff
ered external support for smoking cessation (external
delivery: 69 only external
+
87 both
=
156 external) o
ff
ered referrals to doctors or general practitioners
and 133
/
156 (85.3%) CR programmes o
ff
ered referrals to community-based cessation programmes.
For 73
/
162 (45.1%) CR programmes that o
ff
ered smoking cessation support, patient preference
was the most frequently cited factor for whether a patient attended an internal CR programme’s
smoking cessation service or was referred to external support (Table
5
).  However, eight (4.9%) CR
programmes cited availability as a factor that influenced whether a patient would receive internal or

external support; one (0.6%) reported funding constraints, and 36 (22.2%) CR programmes reportedspecific patient needs (e.g., hardened smoker).

Funding was the most common factor for not providing support for smoking cessation for CR

to stop smoking. The other factor reported by only one CR programme was lack of appropriate sta

4. Discussion
Our research findings show that, after CR, quitters, on average, gain 0.43 kg more than those
who continue to smoke (
p
<
0.001
) and have a BMI of 0.18 kg
/
m
2
more than those who continue
to smoke (
p
<
0.001
).   Although di
ff
erences in weight and BMI scores after CR were statistically
significantly di
ff
erent for quitters and continued smokers (driven by a large sample size of 49,725),
the mean di
ff
erences of 0.43 kg and 0.18 kg
/
m
2
were very small from a clinical perspective and
much lower than previously cited reviews of smoking cessation where the mean weight gain was
around 4 kg [
3
–
5
]. The lack of clinically relevant di
ff
erences in this data are su
ffi
cient to make a strong
clinical recommendation regarding the impact of CR to prevent weight gain when delivered alongsidesmoking cessation in patients with heart disease. Our study shows no clinically significant weight gainin the short term.
Evidence suggests that quitting smoking is associated with a mean increase in body weight
of 3–5 kg, with most weight gain occurring within 3 months of quitting [
3
–
5
]; however, the research
findings reported here show that smokers who quit smoking while attending CR do not gain weight,
which aligns with the findings of Farley et al. that exercise could reduce post-cessation weight gain [
30
].
With regard to smoking and weight interactions, the extent of weight gain associated with smoking
cessation in patients attending CR is much less than previous studies suggest. These research findings
provide evidence that CR is positively associated with weight management during smoking cessation.
The confidence interval for mean di
ff
erence in weight between continued smokers and quitters
after CR was 0.22 to 0.63 kg and for mean di
ff
erence in BMI, it was 0.1 to 0.25 kg
/
m
2
. Because of the
well-documented health benefits of quitting smoking, clinicians should inform smokers about the low
likelihood of weight gain and encourage them to attend CR to avoid excess weight gain.
There is no clinical trial evidence for the e
ff
ectiveness of smoking cessation interventions within CR;
however, our research findings suggest CR as delivered in routine practice is associated with helping
patients quit smoking and reduce the likelihood of weight gain beyond 1 kg. The NACR data regarding
smoking status suggest that about 37.6% of patients who are smoking when recruited to CR successfullystop after CR. Quitting smoking is considered a core element in both primary and secondary prevention
of cardiovascular disease [
31
].
Following CR, quitters on average drink 1.34 units of alcohol fewer than those who continue
to smoke.   Following CR, 43% and 26.6% of quitters improved to achieve the recommended UKmoderate and vigorous physical activity guidelines, respectively, compared with 31.9% and 18% of
continued smokers. An even stronger benefit was seen in both HADS anxiety and depression scores,
which showed that quitters on average score 0.75 and 0.58 less anxious and less depressed than thosewho continue to smoke.
Our survey of smoking cessation support services, o
ff
ered in routine practice to CR attenders,
had a high response rate of 78%.  Although one study has shown low levels of cessation support
97

IJERPH

,
17
, 8565
following hospital discharge [
32
], the e-survey showed that 92.6% of CR programmes in the UK o
ff
er
smoking cessation support for patients attending CR. These results show that CR programmes in theUK adhere to guideline recommendations for smoking cessation interventions [
17
,
33
–
35
]. In addition,
the research results suggest that CR programmes in the UK o
ff
er assistance for patients who smoke by
delivering smoking cessation support at the CR programme site in the form of individualised one-to-onesessions or group educational sessions, as well as referral for external smoking cessation support.
The internal support is provided by the CR team or another qualified member of sta
ff
.  One-to-one
sessions are the dominant service o
ff
ered at the site of CR programmes, while external provision is
predominantly through referral to community-based cessation programmes. Patient preference is the
factor that most influences whether a patient would attend the CR programme (internal) or be referredout (external).
Provision of smoking cessation support in CR could have multiple benefits: the presence of such
a programme could entice more smokers to attend CR, and the increased support for cessation theyreceive could encourage them to remain in the CR programme generally. Prior studies suggest that CRattendance improves smoking cessation rates, and Riley et al.  found a strong relationship betweensmoking cessation and CR attendance [
36
].
Failure of adherence to guideline recommendations to provide support for smoking cessation for
CR attenders was predominantly due to funding challenges. Cutting funds to CR services is a falseeconomy, as evidence shows that smoking cessation services provide e
ff
ective support for smokers
who want to quit [
37
] and the lack of this provision leads to higher costs for the NHS to manage
and treat diseases caused by smoking in the long term.  The National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence (NICE) estimates that for every pound invested in smoking cessation, £2.37 in benefits aregenerated [
38
]. Moreover, the lack of investment in CR programmes may impact on service provision.
In Yorkshire, for example, a qualitative study found sta
ff
to be aware of limited service availability [
39
],
which may influence which patients are invited. Finally, it should not have to be a choice that some
smokers attending CR are supported to quit and others are not.
Comprehensive CR programmes seem to have a beneficial role in helping patients after a cardiac
event  or  procedure,  with  significant  improvements  in  smoking  behaviour,  weight  management,
physical activity levels, psychosocial health, and alcohol consumption. When a comprehensive CR
includes exercise with smoking cessation and patient education, this research initiates evidence forimprovements in cardiac risk factors, particularly increased smoking cessation and improvements in
physical and psychosocial health.
Several limitations of our study must be noted. First, the retrospective observational study design
is limited in capturing data and data quality from CR programmes.  An 18% gap in data capture
was identified due to some programmes not providing their data electronically.   Approximately
31% of patients who began a CR programme did not have post-program data available, a
ff
ecting
data quality. Non-completion of the program leads to missingness in patient records that may a
ff
ect
the representativeness of our sample. Self-reported data poses a limitation in terms of determiningsmoking status and immediate post-CR analysis. Using self-reported data to determine smoking statusmight be subject to recall and social desirability biases.  The self-reported smoking status was not
validated with a biochemical marker.  Some possible factors that influenced quitting smoking have
been missed from the analysis due to high levels of missing data or may not have been collectedin the NACR. Some smoking cessation drugs in addition to the intensity of the smoking cessation
program (number and duration of the visits) may have a
ff
ected the considered outcomes and they
are not included as a confounder in the analyses for the outcomes related to smoking cessation and
weight gain [
40
–
42
]. However, the strengths of our study include utilizing a prospective cohort design
and an observational approach, and using data from a large-scale dataset that collects routine clinicalinformation from CR programmes in the UK. This study also suggested that clinical and researche
ff
orts should be directed towards improving the rate of smoking cessation in patients with CVD by
accounting for factors that predict quitting smoking among CR attendees [
43
].

5. Conclusions
Cardiac rehabilitation is an e
ff
ective intervention to manage weight gain when quitting smoking.
Quitting smoking during CR is associated with a mean increase of 0.4 kg in body weight following CR.Quitters who attended CR improved their physical activity status and psychosocial health measurescompared with smokers.
This  research  is  the  first  to  evaluate  smoking  cessation  support  in  CR  services  in  the  UK,
with  92.6%  of  CR  programmes  in  the  UK  o
ff
ering  smoking  cessation  support  for  CR  attenders.
These results demonstrate adherence of CR in the UK to the guideline recommendations for smoking
cessation interventions.

Abstract:
Aim: To characterize physical exercise programs for older adults in Latin America. Methods:
This review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA statement.  A search for randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) published between the years 2015 and 2020 was performed in the Scopus,
MedLine and SciELO databases. Results: A total of 101 RCTs were included. A large percentage ofthe studies had an unclear risk of bias in the items: selection, performance, detection and attribution.Furthermore, a heterogeneous level of compliance was observed in the CERT items. A total sampleof 5013 older adults (79% women) was included. 97% of the studies included older adults between60–70 years, presenting an adherence to the interventions of 86%. The studies were mainly carriedout in older adults with cardiometabolic diseases.  Only 44% of the studies detailed informationregarding the place of intervention; of these studies, 61% developed their interventions in universityfacilities. The interventions were mainly based on therapeutic physical exercise (89% of the articles),
with a duration of 2–6 months (95% of the articles) and a frequency of 2–3 times a week (95% of the
articles) with sessions of 30–60 min (94% of the articles) led by sports science professionals (51%of the articles).  The components of physical fitness that were exercised the most were muscularstrength (77% of the articles) and cardiorespiratory fitness (47% of the articles). Furthermore, only48% of the studies included a warm-up stage and 34% of the studies included a cool-down stage.Conclusions: This systematic review characterized the physical exercise programs in older adults inLatin America, as well the most frequently used outcome measures and instruments, by summarizingavailable evidence derived from RCTs.  The results will be useful for prescribing future physicalexercise programs in older adults.Keywords:

1. Introduction
The aging process of the population is advancing at an accelerated rate and is related
to a longer life expectancy [
1
]. Thus, it is expected that the fraction of the world population
over 65 years of age will increase from 9% to 16% by the year 2050 [
2
]. Latin America is in
a similar situation, with a 156% increase in the population of older adults (OAs) [
3
].
Aging is characterized by physiological changes that, conditioned by extrinsic and
intrinsic factors, translate into loss of health, conditioning a decline in the physical and
mental skills of OAs [
4
]. Although current evidence supports the bio-psycho-social benefits
of physical activity (PA) and physical exercise (PE), it is known that their practice decreases
with age [
5
].  It is therefore a strong predictor of physical disability [
6
], associated with
an increased risk of mortality. Along these lines, the World Health Organization (WHO)

has reported that around 2.3 million deaths each year are due to physical inactivity [
7
].
The highest levels of physical inactivity in men and women (39%) are registered in Latin
America and the Caribbean [
8
–
10
].
The practice of PA and PE through supervised programs contributes to improving
physical fitness components such as cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, gait and
balance, and to avoid the risk of falls [
11
–
13
], being an effective intervention to delay the
onset characteristic disorders of OA, such as sarcopenia and/or frailty syndrome, whichcause a significant deterioration in functionality and quality of life [
14
–
16
]. On the other
hand, PA and PE also generate positive effects associated with psychosocial and cognitiveaspects in OAs, reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression [
17
].
Current PA and PE recommendations for aging suggest accumulating a minimum of
150 min of moderate aerobic PA or 75 min of vigorous aerobic PA and varied multicom-
ponent physical activities three or more days a week, to improve functional capacity andprevent falls, in addition to perform activities that strengthen the main muscle groups two
or more days a week [
18
–
20
].
At the Latin American level, different countries have proposed guidelines for PA
recommendations (GPAR) for OAs [
21
–
36
].  Although the recommendations proposed
by the WHO for the elaboration of GPAR have been considered as a reference, these are
constantly being updated and differ in specific characteristics such as the type of exercise,frequency and duration, as well as the suggested age for their implementation. In relationto the age group to which these GPAR are directed, there are countries that classify thoseover 65 as elderly, while in Chile this category begins at 60 years. This allows us to infer thatthere could be a heterogeneity in the GPAR of the different Latin American countries. Alongthe same lines, it is of great interest to know if the current evidence that exists regardingthe prescription of PA and PE in OAs has the same heterogeneity in characteristics suchas the type of exercise, analysis variables, measurement instruments, effects on healthoutcomes, and risk of bias. In addition, knowing in depth the latest and updated researchthat is being done in the field of PA and PE and thus having a Latin American map of the
programs developed in the last five years can serve as a basis for future guidelines, guides,
recommendations or programs that wish to be guided by current evidence.
For this reason, the present systematic review aims to characterize the PE programs for
OA in Latin America, focusing on the main characteristics of the interventions developed,
participants, types of exercise, effects, variables and instruments used, risk of bias and level
of compliance with the Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template (CERT) of the articlesincluded. This will allow to start the discussion on the current state of research on PE forOA in the different Latin American countries.2. Materials and Methods
The systematic review was carried out in accordance with the standards established
by the PRISMA statement [
36
]. The PRISMA checklist can be found in the supplementary
article files (Table S1). A systematic review protocol had previously been registered in thePROSPERO repository with the code: CRD42020208833.2.1. Search Strategy for the Identification of Studies
The following databases were reviewed:  MEDLINE by PubMed, SCOPUS by EL-
SEVIER and SciELO. The objective was to identify studies that developed PA and PE
interventions for OAs in Latin America. The search covered the period between 2015 and2020. For the development of the search, the MeSH terms used were: “Exercise”, “Exercise
Therapy” and “Aged”, present in the MeSH Database. The search strategy followed the
Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) guidelines [
37
].
The general search syntax was: (“Exercise” OR “Exercise Therapy”) AND (“Aged”)
and it was adapted to each database applying the following filters:

2.2. Selection of Studies and Inclusion Criteria
All those studies that met the search phrase were considered, and only those that
met the following inclusion criteria were selected: (a) Country: interventions developedin countries belonging to Latin America;  (b) Sample:  people over 60 years of age;  (c)Language:  English, Spanish and Portuguese; (d) Methodological Design:  Randomizedcontrolled clinical trial. No reviews, editorial documents, protocols, or thesis were included.
The articles selected by title and abstract had to meet the conditions indicated in Table

2.3. Data Extraction
Duplicate articles were removed from the databases using Mendeley. Articles that met
the inclusion criteria were selected, and when decisions could not be made considering only
the title and abstract of the article, the full text was retrieved (Figure
1
). A standardized
questionnaire was used and applied by the authors to extract the data from the included
articles,  to  synthesize  the  evidence.   The  information  extracted  included:  (a)  generalcharacteristics of the studies and of the participants (author, year, initial and final sample,adherence, reasons for withdrawal, age range, sex, health condition, recruitment and placeof intervention, (b) main characteristics of the interventions based on physical activity andexercise (duration of the intervention, number of sessions per week, time of the session,responsible professional, type of intervention and components of physical fitness addressedand the time allocated to each one of them); (c) main variables evaluated (physical health,mental health and cognitive abilities); (d) main assessment instruments used (physicalhealth, mental health and cognitive abilities).

Assessment Form
The Cochrane “Cochrane Manual of Systematic Reviews of Interventions” tool [
38
]
was used to assess the methodological validity of the studies included in this review,
evaluating the risk of bias in each of the items proposed by this manual,  detailed as
follows: (a) Selection bias, (b) Performance bias, (c) Detection bias, (d) Attrition bias and
(e) Reporting bias.  Only the item:  “Other biases” was not considered.  The results of
this analysis are presented in Figure
2
. In addition, the Consensus on Exercise Reporting
Template (CERT) assessment form was added to know the proportion of articles that met
the CERT items [
39
] (Table S3).

2.5. Strategy for Data Synthesis
A synthesis of the main findings of the included studies is provided, related to the
interventions developed based on PE for OAs in Latin America. The main information is
presented in summary tables.  In addition, in the discussion, the most relevant method-
ological and applicability aspects are analyzed and some suggestions are given for futureresearch, in order to standardize the application of this methodology.3. Results3.1. Literature Search
Figure
1
shows the flow chart of systematic reviews proposed by the PRISMA state-
ment. 4.642 potential studies on PA and exercise in OAs in Latin America were identified.
After the exclusion of the duplicates in the databases, the screening and eligibility criteria
were applied. Finally, for data synthesis, 101 articles were included [
40
–
140
] (Figure
1
).
3.2. General Characteristics of the Studies
A total of 101 articles were included, of these, 91 were from Brazil, five from Chile, two
Colombia, two Mexico and one from Ecuador. The number of participants at the beginning
of the studies was 5013 and 4334 at the end (79% women and 21% men), presenting acompliance with the interventions of 86%. Only 35% of the studies had 100% adherence.
Three quarters of the studies suffered losses in their sample, the main reasons for with-
drawal being categorized as follows: attendance, does not meet the criteria of the study and
personal reasons, the latter being the one that was repeated the most (78%). Furthermore,
in 15% of the cases the reason for withdrawal was not specified. Regarding the age range,97% of the studies included participants between 60 and 70 years, 83% between 71 and80 years, and only 16% included participants older than 80 years.  The health condition
with the highest prevalence was cardiometabolic diseases. Just over half (58%) of the OAs
resided in the community and 44% of the studies detailed information regarding the placeof intervention; of these studies, 61% of the interventions occurred at university facilities
(Table
2
).

3.3. Assessment of Risk of Bias and CERT Compliance Level
The risk of bias of the studies was assessed using the Cochrane ‘Cochrane Handbook
for Systematic Reviews of experimental study interventions’ tool.  The risk of bias wasincluded for each of the items proposed by the manual, excluding the item “other biases”.It was observed that the distribution of biases classified as unclear risk or high risk wassimilar between the items selection bias, detection bias and attrition bias (40–60% of thestudies). However, it was observed that 95% of the studies had unclear risk and high riskof performance bias, and 100% of the studies had low risk of reporting bias (Figure
2
).
Nine out of nineteen items compliant (rated “yes” on the CERT items) in at least 75%
of the articles (C1 = 90%, C3 = 100%, C4 = 100%, C5 = 93%, C7b = 100%, C10 = 100%,C13 = 100%
, C14a = 100%, C16a = 93%).  The items categories with the highest level of
compliance were those included in the materials (one item, C1 = 90%) and dosage (one item,C13 = 90%) categories. In contrast, the items categories with the lowest level of compliance
were those related to the delivery (ten items, C6 = 5%, C7a = 50%, C8 = 21%, C9 = 0% and
C11 = 41%) and location (one item, C12 = 40%) categories (Table S3).3.4. Main Characteristics of the Interventions
95% of the articles had interventions with a duration of 2 to 6 months, 2% less than
2 months and 3% more than 9 months. 95% had a session frequency of 2 or 3 times a week.
The sessions had a duration that varied between 30 and 60 min in 93.8% of the articles,
taking into account that 20.8% of the studies did not specify this information. In 51% of thestudies the sessions were led by physical activity qualified professionals, such as physicaleducation teachers or personal trainers, while 14% of the studies presented interventionsled by a health professional, most of whom were a physiotherapist. 35% of the studies didnot specify this information. Regarding the training modality, 89% of the studies includedinterventions based on therapeutic PE, 11% of the studies included interventions basedon non-traditional physical disciplines such as Tai Chi, Pilates and dance, 7% includedinterventions based in exercise with digital support, known as Exergames, 5% includedinterventions based on exercise complemented with other interventions such as vibrationand  auriculotherapy  and  2%  included  interventions  based  on  water  training,  knownas hydrogymnastics.  Regarding the components of physical fitness addressed duringthe interventions, 77% of the studies included muscular strength, 47% cardiorespiratoryfitness, 27% balance, 14% coordination, 12% flexibility, 7% gait and 5% proprioception.Furthermore, 48% of the studies included a warm-up stage and 34% of the studies includeda cool-down stage (Table
3
).
Additionally, the characteristics of multicomponent exercise were analyzed according
to the components of physical fitness. Muscle strength was commonly exercised with 1 to3 sets (61%), 8–15 repetitions (71%), and one-minute rest (18%).The intensity of the exercise
was controlled with scales of perception of effort (30%) and multifunctional machines were
used to train (65%). In relation to cardiorespiratory fitness, this was developed mainly ona treadmill (39%), for 20 min or more (61%). The intensity of the exercise was controlledthrough the heart rate (52%). With regard to flexibility, this was exercised through staticstretching (25%) and was controlled through the time performed (42%), With regard togait, coordination, and proprioception, these components of fitness were trained primarilythrough circuits (56%, 50% and 40, respectively).3.5. Outcome Variables Analyzed
Outcome variables were grouped and described in three broad categories: (a) physical
health, (b) mental health and quality of life and (c) cognitive skills.
(a)
Physical health: This category was considered in 100% of the studies and was divided
into 10 outcome variables. Of these, the most evaluated was muscle strength (74 of the
studies). The following most frequent were: nutritional status and diet, functionality,balance, gait and vital signs, blood tests and others (blood pressure, pain, dyspnea,

heart rate variability and blood tests). The least evaluated was coordination (7 studies)
(Figure
3
a).
(b)
Mental health and quality of life: The mental health and quality of life categories were
considered only in 28% of the studies, and was grouped into nine outcome variablesrelated to emotional, psychological and social well-being. The most evaluated was
quality of life, included in 17 studies, followed by depression and fear of falling,
evaluated in eight and six studies, respectively (Figure
3
b).
(c)
Cognitive Skills: the category of cognitive skills was considered only in 11% of thestudies and 12 outcome variables were grouped. The most evaluated was language,included in six of the studies, followed by memory, attention and executive function,evaluated in five studies (Figure
3
c).

3.6. Assessment Instruments Used
The evaluations were grouped and described in three broad categories: (a) physical
health, (b) mental health and quality of life, and (c) cognitive skills.
(a)
Physical health instruments:  63 instruments were used, which were grouped intoten categories (strength, flexibility, cardiorespiratory fitness, walk test, balance, chairtest, step test, risk of falls, functionality and body composition), being the most usedinstruments the maximum repetition to measure muscle strength (33 studies), thesit-to-stand test in tests that use a chair (24 studies), the timed up and go in tests ofrisk of falling (20 studies) and the test of 6-min walk in walking tests (17 studies)
(Figure
4
a).
(b)
Mental health and quality of life instruments: 18 instruments were used, which weregrouped into four categories (quality of sleep, suspected depression, quality of lifeand others, which included instruments that evaluated affectivity, efficacy, mood,feelings, entertainment and perception barriers). The most widely used instruments
were the Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I), the World Health Organization
Quality of Life (WHOQoL), the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the YesavageGeriatric Depression (YGDS) (Figure
4
b).
(c)
Cognitive skills instruments: 22 instruments were used that were grouped into twocategories (cognitive skills and suspected dementia).   Of all the instruments,  themost used were the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) in five studies and theMontreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (Figure
4
c).
3.7. Effects by Sex and Type of Intervention
Regarding the effects of physical exercise interventions according to sex, in the phys-
ical health category, more than 50% of the articles with female-only samples presentedsignificant effects in six of nine outcomes. More than 50% of the articles with male-onlysamples presented significant effects in four of seven outcomes, and more than 50% ofthe articles with mixed samples (both sexes) presented significant effects in three of nineoutcome variables. In the mental health category, more than 50% of the articles with female-only samples presented significant effects in two of five outcomes. Articles with male-onlysamples did not include mental health outcome variables. More than 50% of the articles
with mixed samples (both sexes) presented significant effects in four of six outcomes.
Regarding the cognitive skills category, more than 50% of the articles with female-onlysamples presented significant effects in four of 10 outcomes.  100% of the articles with
male-only samples presented significant effects in eight of eight outcome variables. Morethan 50% of the articles with mixed samples (both sexes) presented significant effects infive of 10 outcomes (Figure
5
).
Regarding the effects according to the type of intervention, in the physical health
category, more than 50% of the therapeutic physical exercise-based interventions presentedsignificant effects in seven of nine outcomes.  More than 50% of the hydrogymnastics-based interventions had significant effects in three of six outcomes. More than 50% of thenon-traditional physical disciplines-based interventions had significant effects in two ofnine outcomes.  More than 50% of the digitally supported exercise-based interventionshad significant effects in one of nine outcomes.   More than 50% of the exercise-basedinterventions complemented with other interventions had significant effects in two of fiveoutcomes. Regarding the mental health category, more than 50% of therapeutic physicalexercise-based interventions presented significant effects in six of nine outcomes. There
was no hydrogymnastics-based intervention that evaluated mental health outcomes. More
than 50% of the non-traditional physical disciplines-based interventions had significanteffects in one of three outcomes. More than 50% of the digitally supported exercise-basedinterventions had significant effects in one of three outcomes and 100% of the exercise-basedinterventions complemented with other interventions had significant effects on fear offalling. Regarding the category of cognitive skills, more than 50% of the therapeutic physicalexercise-based interventions presented significant effects in 11 of 12 outcomes. There was
115

4. Discussion
The main results of this systematic review focused on five large areas: general charac-
teristics, risk of bias and level of compliance with the CERT of the articles, characteristicsof  the  interventions,  outcome  measures,  and  instruments  used  for  their  analysis.   Itsimportance and possible implications are discussed below.4.1. General Characteristics of the Articles Reviewed
Regarding  the  geographic  location,  the  interventions occurred  in  only  five  Latin
American countries, most of them in Brazil.  This could be associated with the fact that
Brazil is the country with the largest population in Latin America, and the sixth in the
world  [
141
],  being  also  one  of  the  Latin  American  countries  that  invests  the  most  in
developing and publishing research in the area of biological and medical sciences [
142
,
143
].
Regarding the characteristics of OA, female participants predominated (79%), which isstriking considering that South American population surveys position women as more
physically inactive than men [
144
]. Adherence was higher than 80% in 75% of the studies,
which suggests a high degree of commitment to this type of intervention and contrastswith the evidence that indicates that the practice of AP decreases over the years [
145
]. In
addition, OAs were mainly recruited from the community and most of the interventions
were carried out in university facilities, suggesting that OA living in the community arewilling to participate in PE-related activities. This could motivate researchers to develop
interventions that include more OAs as study subjects in future research. Although theevidence is clear that the benefits of PA and PE are independent of age and health status [
11
],
it is interesting that only 16% of the studies included people over 80 years of age, whichcould be associated with the higher prevalence of comorbidities at that age [
146
].  This
would generate a higher risk of unwanted side effects related to exercise,  although if
the training program is prescribed properly, the risk of side effects should be like thosethat occur in OAs below 80 years [
9
,
10
]. Regarding the health condition of the OAs, the
comorbidities with the highest prevalence were neurodegenerative and cardiometabolicdiseases, which is related to the increase in NCDs worldwide [
13
].
4.2. Evaluation of the Methodological Quality of the Studies and CERT Compliance
From the results found, it stands out that 95% of the studies presented unclear risk
and high risk in performance bias.  This point is relevant as it is related to the blinding
of the study participants and staff, and although the Cochrane manual states that simplyblinding does not ensure successful blinding, it also states that the lack of blinding in thisitem could produce a bias by affecting the results of the participants [
39
].  In any case,
the predominant classification in this item was unclear risk, which is associated with alack of information on this bias by the authors, rather than a possible bias in the results.On the contrary, 100% of the studies presented a low-risk classification in the reportingbias item.   This could be due to the fact that all the studies had an experimental and
randomized methodological design (RCT), which corresponds to the best level of evidencein quantitative studies. Only nine out of nineteen items compliant in at least 75% of theRTC analyzed. Furthermore, the items categories with the highest level of compliance werethose included in the materials and dosage categories. Conversely, the item categories withthe lowest level of compliance were those related to the delivery and location categories.Similar results on the level of compliance had already been observed in another systematicreview. This could be because the CERT was developed in 2016 with the goal of makingexercise-based clinical trials transparent and replicable and have not yet been sufficientlyassimilated by researchers [
147
].
4.3. Main Characteristics of the Interventions
Most of the interventions had a duration of 2 to 6 months, with a frequency of 2 to
3 times a week and a duration of 30 to 60 min per session, and were directed by quali-fied professionals, characteristics that are related to the WHO recommendations [
19
,
20
]
118

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health
2021
,
18
, 2812
and to the GPAR [
21
–
35
].  89% of the interventions were based on traditional PE, while
11% of the studies included interventions based on non-traditional disciplines such as
Tai Chi and Pilates, disciplines that in recent years have increased their adherence and
level  of  evidence  [
44
,
81
,
111
,
125
,
148
]  being  even  included  by  some  countries  in  their
GPAR [
21
,
27
,
29
,
32
,
33
]. 7% of the studies included exercise-based interventions with digital
support, known as Exergames [
74
,
78
,
117
,
120
,
126
] a modality not so well known today,
which has been shown to be effective in improving balance and mobility function in
OA [
149
,
150
].  On the other hand, some authors suggest that more research is lacking
regarding this type of interventions and the effects they propose [
151
]. 2% of the studies
included interventions based on hydro gymnastics [
125
,
127
], and although few studies
have covered this type of exercise, it has shown positive effects on the physical function-ing of OAs [
152
].  Finally, 5% included exercise interventions supplemented with other
interventions such as vibration and auriculotherapy [
48
,
57
,
82
,
140
]. Regarding the vibra-
tion modality, benefits have been shown in physical performance [
153
] and in balance
and gait of OAs [
154
], in addition to being an effective intervention to reduce the risk of
falls [
155
]. However, some authors suggest that more evidence is needed to know which
is the most effective vibration modality [
156
]. This indicates that although interventions
based on traditional exercise predominate (mainly resistance training [
157
] and aerobic
training [
158
]), whose effects have been widely supported, non-traditional interventions
have been developed during the last decade that have shown to be as effective as traditionalexercise interventions [
48
,
57
,
82
,
140
]. Regarding the components of the interventions, 77%
considered the muscle strength component as the main training variable and 47% theaerobic exercise, the latter being the first recommendation by the WHO and the GPAR. Thismay be due to the fact that muscle strength training, associated with an improvement inmuscle quality in OAs, is more closely related to improvements in functionality, decreasedrisk of falls, and health-related improvements in quality of life [
159
,
160
], variables in which
aerobic training has a minor effect [
160
]. At the same time, the small number of studies that
consider the training of balance, coordination and proprioception components within theirinterventions is striking, given that alteration of these components increases the risk of falls.
This variable that is of great interest to OAs, because falls are associated with a decrease in
functionality, a higher level of dependency and a higher risk of mortality [
12
–
16
]. Lastly,
the flexibility component was considered only in 7% of the studies, a variable that is not
specifically found within the WHO recommendations, and is only found in some of theGPAR. This contrasts with the fact that flexibility exercises have been shown to improveaspects of physical health and mental well-being in OAs [
36
,
161
].
A fifth of the studies included in this review developed combined PE interventions,
modalities known as concurrent training and multicomponent training, which had positiveeffects on the variables studied.   In particular,  the multicomponent training modality,
which has important scientific support in terms of its effectiveness [
162
,
163
],  is being
strongly recommended in the European continent for the development of PA in OA [
164
].
In addition, it could be that in the near future, the recommendations proposed by the
WHO will undergo modifications, proposing multicomponent training as a more effective
alternative than training each component of physical fitness in isolation in OA.4.4. Outcome Variables Studied in the Articles and Instruments Used in Evaluations
The aging process is not only associated with deterioration in physical skills, but also
with disorders of mental health and cognitive skills [
165
]. Along these lines, although the
interventions were based on PE that considered physical health variables in 100% of thestudies, 28% of the studies also considered the effects of these interventions on mentalhealth variables and 11% on cognitive skills.  Even though the percentage is low, this isrelated to understanding how exercise is a therapeutic agent with multiple benefits in thehealth of OA [
17
].
Sixty-three instruments were used to evaluate the physical health variables, 18 to
evaluate the mental health variables, and 22 to evaluate the cognitive skills variables. This
119

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health
2021
,
18
, 2812
highlights the great diversity of instruments used to identify the effects of PE in OA, andalthough there are some instruments that are used more frequently, this highlights the lackof consensus that exists for the evaluation of the different variables.4.5. Effects by Sex and by Type of Intervention
Regarding the effects of interventions by sex,  positive effects were observed in a
greater number of physical health outcome measures in male-only samples, in a greater
number of mental health outcome measures in mixed samples, and in a greater number ofcognitive function outcome measures in single samples of men. Older women are knownto have lower levels of PA and fitness than older men [
144
].  Considering this baseline
condition, a PE-based intervention could show greater benefits for women in the different
physical health outcomes [
166
], Furthermore, it has been observed that mixed sample
generates greater collaboration, motivation and challenge for OA of both genders [
167
].
In relation to the effects according to different types of exercise, positive effects were
observed in a greater number of physical health, mental health and cognitive functionoutcome measures in therapeutic PE-based interventions.  This could be related to thefact that this type of intervention is usually implemented as an intervention for OA withaltered physical health status.  In addition, this type of intervention is more structured,individualized and with specific objectives for each participant, allowing greater control ofexercise dose such as intensity, frequency, length and training progression. Furthermore,therapeutic PE-based interventions commonly included in the same session a greaternumber of components of physical condition [
45
,
100
,
103
,
131
], than those interventions
based on non-traditional disciplines. Hydro-gymnastics and with digital support, whichalthough have shown positive effects in some interventions,  some authors agree thatevidence to support their effects is lacking [
151
,
156
]. In particular, therapeutic PE-based
interventions seem to improve muscle strength in a greater number of RTC. This findingcould be associated with the fact that other types of exercise such as hydro-gymnastics-based interventions and digitally supported exercise-based interventions consider verylight workloads and are more focused on other fitness qualities, such as aerobic endurance,balance and coordination [
151
].
Additionally, the component of physical fitness with the most positive effects was
balance, regardless of sex and type of intervention. The interventions were mainly witha duration of 3 months, a frequency of 3 times a week, with 30–60 min sessions.  OAsoften have problems with balance [
168
].  Thus, PE-based interventions could promote
improvements in these components of physical fitness [
169
,
170
].
Particularly, quality of life improved regardless of the type of exercise trained, which
reinforces the positive effect of PE on health-related quality of life of the elderly [
171
,
172
].
In cognitive skills, therapeutic PE-based interventions, presenting effectiveness greater than60% of the articles in 11 of the 12 analyzed outcomes. It should be noted that few studiesanalyzed mental health and cognitive skills outcomes, most of which were therapeuticPE-based interventions.  This finding suggests a lack of evidence on mental health andcognitive skills outcomes that should be explored in future research.4.6. Limitations
Although articles from other countries such as Chile, Mexico, Ecuador and Colombia
were considered, most of the included studies were developed in Brazil, which does not
allow a complete overview in relation to PE interventions for OAs in all of Latin America.
This in turn could be considered a challenge for researchers in the rest of the Latin American
countries in terms of developing similar research in their respective countries.  On theother hand, we restricted the search the last 5 years to find the latest and updated availableevidence.  We are aware that there may be high-quality evidence in previous years that
was not included. Another limitation of this review was the quality of the RTCs included.
Thus, a high percentage of RCTs had unclear risk of bias in selection bias, performance
bias, detection bias, and attrition bias. In addition, 52.6% of the CERT items showed a low
120

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health
2021
,
18
, 2812
percentage of articles that complied with describing and detailing the CERT categories.
Furthermore, this scoping review lacked meta-analysis due to the studies’ heterogeneity,so there is only a qualitative analysis of the phenomenon studied.4.7. How Does this Literature Review Contribute to the Existing One?
This systematic review provides a broad and updated view of the characteristics of
the PA and PE interventions that are being developed in Latin America, thus allowing thegeneration of a profile, outcome variables, and evaluation instruments used. On the otherhand, this review allowed to identify that, although there are certain similarities betweenthe recommendations proposed by the WHO and the GPAR of the different Latin Americancountries, there are also differences, for example, in the type of exercise, its frequency andits duration. Therefore, this review could serve to determine the more and less frequentcharacteristics of the interventions used by Latin American researchers.
This review also provides updated information derived from RTC on the character-
istics of PE based-interventions, as well as the most frequently used outcome measuresand instruments that should serve to help exercise professionals prescribe exercise forolder adults.
Additionally, it allowed the understanding of new PE modalities that are being im-
plemented and their characteristics, being able to encourage the development of future
studies that are based on non-traditional PE interventions, in little-explored age groups
and health conditions.5. Conclusions
A total of 101 articles were included (90% focused on Brazil), with a total sample of
5013 OA (79% women). 97% of the studies included participants between 60–70 years ofage.  The studies had an average adherence of 86%.  The main cause of withdrawal was
personal reasons (78% of cases). The studies were mainly carried out with OAs who lived
in the community with the diagnosis of some disease, with cardiometabolic diseases beingthe most prevalent. A large percentage of studies had an unclear risk of bias in the items:selection, performance, detection and attrition.  Furthermore, a heterogeneous level ofcompliance was observed in the CERT items.  The interventions were mainly based ontherapeutic PE, lasted between 2–6 months, with a frequency of 2–3 times a week, witha duration of sessions between 30–60 min and were led by professionals of PA sciences.For the most part, there was no warm-up stage before exercise and cool-down stage afterexercise. As well as the components of physical fitness that were exercised the most weremuscle strength and cardiorespiratory fitness.
This systematic review provides a broad and updated view of the characteristics of
PE-based interventions that are being developed for OAs in Latin America. The findings
will be useful for prescribing future PE programs for OAs, being able to encourage the
development of future studies in this area of knowledge.Supplementary Materials:

Abstract:
Background: The purpose of this systematic review was to: (I) determine the quality of
evidence from studies assessing trunk isokinetic strength in subjects with acute low back pain (ALBP)compared to healthy subjects and (II) establish reference values of isokinetic trunk strength in subjects
with ALBP. Methodology:  Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) statements were followed using keywords associated with trunk, strength and low back
pain. Four databases were used: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and SPORTDiscus. Methodological
quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS).
Results:  A total of 1604 articles were retrieved, four included in this review.  All were evaluatedas high risk of bias (Rob).  Due to the high Rob and the diversity of protocols, instruments and
variables used, it was not possible to determine reference values for subjects with ALBP, we can only
establish a range of flexion peak torque (PT) between 175.1 and 89.7 Nm at 60
◦
/s and between 185
and
81.5 Nm
at 120
◦
/s, and for extension PT between 240.0 and 91.5 Nm at 60
◦
/s and between 217.5
and
69.2 Nm
at 120
◦
/s in subjects with ALBP. Conclusions: Due to the low quality of the evidence
and the diversity of protocols used when measuring trunk isokinetic strength, it is necessary to carryout new high-quality research to establish reference values of trunk strength in subjects with ALBP.Keywords:

1. Introduction
Low back pain (LBP) is among the three leading causes of years lived with disability [
1
],
only in 2017 577 million people suffered from LBP [
2
]. LBP refers to pain, muscle tension
or stiffness below the costal border and over the lower gluteal fold, with or without sciatia.It can be classified according to its duration in acute low back pain (ALBP), less thansix weeks, or chronic low back pain (CLBP) when the pain persists for more than threemonths [
3
]. It is estimated that 80% of the population will suffer from LBP at least once
in their lives [
4
,
5
], but these symptoms should disappear within six weeks.  Although a
significant number of patients will have recurrences or persistent pain and disability [
6
,
7
],
even in the follow-up to one year, some patients will still show mild to moderate levels of
pain and disability [
8
]. Da Silva et al. [
9
] reports a pain episode recurrence in 70% of the
patients within 12 months after recovery from the first ALBP episode, of which 40% will
suffer a moderate functional limitation or will need to use the health system, suggestingthat the good prognosis of ALBP has been overestimated.
Regarding the cause of the LBP, it is not often possible to determine an anatomical
source of pain (e.g., epidural abscess, compression fracture, spondyloarthropathy, malig-nancy or cauda equina syndrome) [
10
]. Most of the times, in 90% of cases, no specific cause
is identified for which it is denominated non-specific LBP (NSLBP) [
10
]. However, multiple

factors have been associated with the occurrence of NSLBP, among them the alteration ofthe neuromuscular response of the trunk [
11
,
12
], the deconditioning (or decrease in the
function) of the lumbar musculature [
13
,
14
], the reduction in the muscular mass of the
trunk [
15
], and the reduction in the muscular strength of the trunk [
13
,
16
,
17
].
The spine needs to be mechanically stable at all times to avoid injuries that can even-
tually lead to pain [
18
].  Maintaining this stability is role of the active neuromuscular
system [
19
], and thus the trunk strength plays an important role in different aspects related
to health and sport [
20
–
23
]. The trunk is the center of the kinematic chains, transferring
forces and acting as a bridge between the upper and lower extremities [
24
].  Arms and
legs can be compared with their contralateral to define deficits or imbalances but, unlikethe extremities, the trunk does not have this possibility, which makes it difficult to find
parameters of normality or reference.  Trunk strength has been related to injury preven-
tion [
25
,
26
], which is why it plays an important role in the functional evaluation of people
or athletes [
27
,
28
].
To evaluate trunk strength, several methods have been developed. The gold standard
is the isokinetic dynamometry, which consists of measuring muscle strength capacity underlinear or rotational movements at constant velocities [
29
].  This method allows a quick
quantification of several muscle function parameters at different positions and angular
velocities, and its use has been recommended for clinical and research purposes [
30
].
Prospective studies have shown that trunk strength imbalance [
17
] and decreased
trunk muscle strength could be considered risk factors for developing NSLBP, specificallyisometric and isokinetic strength of trunk flexors and lumbar extensors muscles [
16
]. To
the best of our knowledge, there are no reference values in the development of the first
episode of ALBP; instead, the evidence shows that, when comparing healthy subjects withCLBP patients, the lumbar extensor peak torque is lower, but the flexor peak torque doesnot decrease in the same way, so the ratio flexors/extensors (F/E) do not decrease [
31
].
These data are important since the parameters of isokinetic strength could be used for
the early detection of people at risk for developing NSLBP. However,  these referencedata correspond to subjects with CLBP, and were obtained from reviews in which no
assessment of the quality of the evidence was carried out. This could limit our confidencein the reported data [
31
,
32
].  Furthermore, in CLBP, the evidence shows that pain and
disability do have physical causes and have multifactorial etiology [
33
], with psychological
factors [
34
], central sensitization [
35
] and kinesiophobia [
36
] playing a role in this type
of patient.  De Souza et al. [
37
] demonstrated that the peak torque of lumbar extensors
in women with CLBP who have fear or negative beliefs related to the activity could bemodified merely by using kinesiotape.  This suggests that probably the strength valuesobtained in this type of patient may be influenced by other processes related to chronic
pain and may not be an appropriate measurement on their own.
This allows us to question whether we estimate the ability to exert maximum trunk
strength in subjects with chronic pain. Establishing whether an alteration in trunk musclestrength is present in those subjects who suffer from ALBP compared to healthy subjects is
paramount in order to be able to develop training programs for preventing ALBP in the
general population, and to manage this type of patient, avoiding its progression to CLBP. Itis necessary to have data on the trunk’s isokinetic strength in patients with ALBP that willallow determination of which people are at risk for developing ALBP and thus preventits appearance in healthy people. Moreover, this is necessary to manage it and avoid its
progression to CLBP. Thus, the objective of this systematic review was (I) to determine the
quality of evidence from studies assessing trunk isokinetic strength in subjects with ALBP
compared to healthy subjects and (II) establish reference values of isokinetic trunk strengthin subjects with ALBP.

2. Materials and Methods
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses guidelines
(PRISMA) were used [
38
] (Supplementary Table S1).  The protocol of this review was
registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020193458).2.1. Study Search
Two  authors  (WR-F  and  DJ-M)  conducted  the  search.   The  databases  used  were
PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and SPORTDiscus. The search was carried out from theirinception to October 2020, the following keywords were included: “isokinetic”, “musclestrength”, “dynamometer”, “CORE”, “abdominal muscles”, “abdominal wall”, “torso”,
“trunk”, “low back pain”, “low back ache” y “lumbago”. Search strategies are presented in
Supplementary Table S2.2.2. Eligibility Criteria
Articles that met the following criteria were included in this review.  For aim (I):
adult participants (age
≥
18 years old), measures of isokinetic trunk flexors and extensors
strength comparing a group of individuals with ALBP with a healthy control group, full-text available, and articles in English. For aim (II), the criteria for aim (I) were applied, butall the studies assessing isokinetic trunk flexors and extensors strength in individuals with
ALBP, regardless of having a healthy control group or not, were included. Studies that only
included either healthy people or subjects with chronic low-back pain were excluded.2.3. Study Selection
Articles that were found eligible for inclusion in this review were entered into the
Rayyan QCRI application, an app that assists in the article selection process, optimizing thescreening time and allowing collaborative tasks (available for free at
http://rayyan.qcri.org
(accessed on 19 June 2020)) [
39
]. Duplicate references were removed, and two independent
researchers (WR-F and DJ-M) reviewed titles and abstracts to identify articles met theeligibility criteria. The selected articles were then read in full, and the reference list waschecked for relevant articles that could be included.2.4. Assessment of the Risk of Bias and Quality of Evidence
Each article included in this systematic review was independently assessed for method-
ological quality and risk of bias by two researchers (WR-F and DJ-M). To the best of ourknowledge, there is no scale for methodological evaluation adequate for the purpose ofthis review; therefore, we used the checklist proposed by Castro et al. [
40
], which combines
some items from QUADAS [
41
] and a checklist to evaluate the methodological quality of
both randomized and non-randomized studies of health care interventions [
42
]. This scale
has 15 items divided into three sections (study sample, test procedures and data analysis,and results presentation). Each item was scored as “yes,” “no,” “unclear,” or “not applied”.
A study was considered high risk of bias (low quality) when it received five or more “no”
or “unclear” scores; in contrast, a study was considered low risk of bias (high quality)
when it received less than five “no” or “unclear” scores. This cut-off score was determined
on the basis of previous reviews that determined that 30% of negative results discriminatebetween studies of low or high methodological quality [
43
]. In case of disagreement among
researchers, the consensus approach was used; for the case in which consensus could notbe reached, a third researcher was consulted (LC-R).2.5. Data Extraction and Analysis
The data extraction was performed by each researcher independently; the information
extracted  was  related  to  the  identification  of  the  article  (authors,  year  of  publication,design and objective), the characteristics of the participants (total sample, gender, age,
weight and height) and the isokinetic evaluation protocol (movement, position, range of
133

, 2576
movement, angular velocity, repetitions and contraction mode), in addition to results andmain conclusions.3. Results3.1. Article Selection
No systematic reviews with a similar objective as the present study were found. From
the initial search,  a total of 1603 articles were retrieved (Figure
1
),  of which 610 were
eliminated because they were duplicates. One additional article was identified from othersources. All the articles that assessed isokinetic trunk strength in individuals with ALBP
presented a control group. Therefore, the number of articles included for aim (I) and aim
(II) were the same. After evaluating titles and abstracts, 977 articles were excluded because
they did not meet the inclusion criteria, leaving 17 articles for full-text analysis.Figure 1.
Flow chart for the systematic review.
Of the 17 articles, two could not be retrieved because when contacting the authors,
they did not have a digital copy to share due to the age of the publication (1982 and 1994).Of the remaining 15, after reading the full text, 11 articles were eliminated because theydid not include the evaluation of subjects with ALBP. Thus, four articles were selected, andtheir reference lists were checked, and there were no new articles found.3.2. Characteristics of the Studies
Table
1
presents the main characteristics of the included studies.  One study [
44
]
divided patients according to the duration of symptoms as acute and chronic, two [
45
,
46
]
did so in acute, subacute and chronic, and only one [
47
] considered only subjects with acute
pain. The number of participants with ALBP ranged from 21 to 46 subjects; Gabr et al. [
46
]
do not indicate the exact number of ALBP subjects enrolled in their study. Age was notspecified in the ALBP group in three of four studies, with only Hupli et al. [
47
] reporting
an average age of 40.1
±
8.9 years for men and 43.5
±
9.2 for women. The physical activity
profile was reported in only one study [
47
], but it does not specify which tool is measured.

Regarding the isokinetic dynamometer used,  Suzuki et al. [
44
] used Cybex II,
Akebi et al. [
45
]
did not specify it, Hupli et al. [
47
] compared two dynamometers: Ariel
5000 (Ariel dynamics Inc., Trabuco Canyon, CA, USA) and Lido Multi-Joint II (loredan
Biomedical, Inc., West Sacramento, CA, USA), while Gabr et al. [
46
] used biodex system
4 pro.  Regarding the position in which the trunk strength was measured, three studies
were  performed  in  the  standing  position  with  knees  in  semi-flexion  [
45
–
47
]  and  one
study [
44
] used the supine position.  In relation to the range of movement used, there
was no concordance among the studies. One study used natural movement [
47
], another
one 30
◦
of flexion–extension [
44
], another one [
45
] a range of 0
◦
–60
◦
and another one the

The strength variables calculated were: (I) average peak torque (Nm), (II) trunk flexion
(J), (III) trunk extension (J), (IV) abdominal strength (J), (V) average power, (VI) flexion–
extension ratio (%) (flexion strength/extensor strength), (VII) fatigue (%) calculated as:
(initial muscle strength–final muscle strength/initial muscle strength) x 100, and (VIII)
Coefficient of Torque Variation (%).3.3. Methodological Quality and Risk of Bias
In this review,  57 items (95%) were evaluated in the agreement between the two
reviewers, the remaining three were decided by agreement (Table

3.3.1. Sample
Regarding the sample, three studies [
44
,
46
,
47
] describe the sample properly (item 1),
however, only Gabr et al. [
46
] specified the inclusion criteria (item 2), none of the included
articles explained how the sample size was calculated (item 3).3.3.2. Procedure
In relation to the trunk isokinetic evaluation procedure, two studies [
45
,
47
] report a
familiarization process prior to measurement (item 4), none of them properly report thetype or sequence of contraction only reporting the angular velocity used (item 5), onlyone study [
47
] reports a randomized order in the evaluations (item 6), and none of the
four inform of the dominance of the extremities (item 7) which was evaluated as “not
applied” because it is the trunk. All four studies [
44
–
47
] correctly describe the assessment
position, the movements, and the form of stabilization used (item 8). None of the studies
specify whether or not the same encouragement was given to each participant during theassessment (item 9). Considering the data analysis, only Hupli et al. [
47
] report that the
136

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health
2021
,
18
, 2576
Lido dynamometer software compensates for gravity, while Ariel does not (item 10); it isnot clear if the other three studies performed gravity correction. Regarding the dependent
variable, two studies clearly describe how the data extraction was performed [
46
,
47
], while,
in the other two studies [
44
,
45
], it is not clear how data such as fatigue or the coefficient of
variation were determined. None of the studies clarify whether the data were extracted
from the isokinetic load range (item 12), and none report reliability measures, such as theintra-class correlation coefficient or standard error measurement (item 13).3.3.3. Presentation of Results
Regarding the presentation of results, three studies [
44
,
46
,
47
] adequately presented
the results (item 14) and two [
45
,
46
] properly presented the inferential statistics (item 15).
In summary, the four studies showed a high risk of bias [
44
–
47
].
3.4. Trunk Strength Parameters
Only two studies [
46
,
47
] measured peak torque in a similar way (Table
3
).
3.4.1. Average Peak Torque in Flexion and Extension
Two studies [
46
,
47
] determined the average peak torque in flexion and extension
in healthy subjects and those with ALBP, measuring in standing,  concentric mode,  at
velocities of 60
◦
/s and 120
◦
/s.  Hupli et al. [
47
] compared men and women with ALBP
and healthy subjects using two dynamometers, finding small, non-statistically significantdifferences between groups. Gabr et al, [
46
] when comparing men with ALBP and healthy
controls, found significant differences in the peak torque of flexors (
p
= 0.004) and extensors
(
p
= 0.003)
at 60
◦
/s and flexors (
p
< 0.001) and extensors (
p
< 0.001) at 120
◦
/s, with an
inverse F/E ratio at speeds of 120
◦
/s in the ALBP group (Table
3
).
3.4.2. Coefficient of Variation
Akebi et al. [
45
] evaluated the relationship of the variability of the torque curves
(CV) between subjects with ALBP and healthy controls finding CV values lower than the
evaluation at 60
◦
/s compared to 120
◦
/s and, in addition, in both men and women the CV
was lower in the control subjects compared to ALBP (Table
3
).
3.4.3. Average Power
Gabr et al. [
46
] found significant differences between average power in flexion (
p
= 0.004
)
and extension (
p
= 0.014) at 60
◦
/s and between average power in flexion (
p
= 0.001)
and
extension (
p
= 0.045) at 120
◦
/s between men with ALBP and a control group (Table
3
).
3.5. Adverse Outcome from Trunk Isokinetic Assessment
From all the articles reviewed, none report adverse effects during trunk strength
measurement using an isokinetic dynamometer in patients with ALBP. Suzuki et al. [
44
]
and Gabr et al. [
46
] report that the assessment was performed without any complaints,
Akebi et al. [
45
] do not report any undesirable effects during the assessment, and only
Hupli et al. [
47
] reports a pain measured with visual analogue scale (VAS) (0–100) of 26.3
using the Ariel dynamometer and 15.2 with the Lido dynamometer in subjects with ALBP.

4. Discussion
The present systematic review was designed to (I) determine the quality of evidence
from studies assessing trunk isokinetic strength in subjects with ALBP compared to healthysubjects and (II) establish reference values of isokinetic trunk strength in subjects with
ALBP. The main findings of this study were (I) the articles included in this review present
a high risk of bias; therefore, this indicates low quality of evidence, and (II) it was not
possible to determine reference values, neither was it possible to determine whether trunk
strength can distinguish between patients with ALBP and healthy subjects. However, basedon data provided in the articles reviewed, we can report a range of peak flexion torque

◦

217.5 Nm and 69.2 Nm at 120

In addition to considering research with a low risk of bias, we should also consider
studies with similar evaluation protocols to suggest reference values. Estr
á
zulas et al. [

after reviewing the literature, recommend reliable protocols for the evaluation of trunkflexors and extensors, carried out in a sitting position at velocities of 30
◦
/s and 60
◦
/s with a
range of 30
◦
(10
◦
of flexion and 20
◦
of extension) and/or in a standing position at velocities
of 60
◦
/s and 90
◦
/s with a range between 90
◦
and 95
◦
of flexion and 15
◦
of extension, both
protocols in concentric mode with the axis in the anterior superior iliac spine. In the four
studies reviewed, none included evaluation in sitting position; three of them [
45
–
47
] used
the standing position but in a different range to the suggested and with velocities of 60
◦
/s
and 120
◦
/s, which are commonly used in the measurement of trunk strength [
48
].
Concerning the variable analyzed, we know that the peak torque is widely used as
a reference, allowing a direct comparison between studies.  It has been previously used
by Mueller et al. [
31
,
49
] to analyze subjects with low back pain, to determine deficits and
to assess the effectiveness of training or therapy. In this review, two of the four includedstudies used peak torque in their analysis; however, Hupli et al. [
47
] found differences
between the dynamometers used and therefore conclude and recommend that these datashould not be compared among themselves. Analyzing this same variable, Gabr et al. [
46
]
found that, unlike patients with CLBP, patients with ALBP have a significant reductionin the strength of trunk flexors and extensors, with an inverse F/E ratio at 120
◦
/s, that is,
greater than one, which indicates that the extensor muscles were mostly affected by the
weakness. Mueller et al. [
31
] had previously reported the same, but with data from CLBP
subjects, where a greater decrease in extensors’ strength was observed than in flexors, sothe F/E ratio was higher than in healthy subjects. It is important to note that only the 60
◦
/s
flexor values obtained by Gabr et al. [
46
] are similar to those described by Mueller et al. [
31
]
for the CLBP group, and those of 60
◦
/s flexors in healthy subjects by Hupli et al. [
47
]
with the control group by Mueller et al. [
31
]. On the other hand, Suzuki et al. [
44
] report
differences in the strength of flexors and trunk extensors between ALBP and asymptomaticsubjects, however, this variable was measured in Joules, which does not allow comparison,and also only indicates the existence of statistical differences,  but does not report thep
-value.
It is important to consider that none of the studies included in this review performed
an isometric strength assessment of trunk flexors and extensors in subjects with ALBPusing an isokinetic dynamometer.  Among the studies reviewed, only Suzuki et al [
44
]
evaluated isometric strength; however, they considered as a single group patients with
acute and chronic pain (who had an average of eleven years of pain); so, unfortunately, it
was not possible to distinguish isometric strength values in subjects with ALBP. Isometric
evaluation is reliable in subjects with CLBP [
50
], and lower values of trunk strength have
been observed in athletes and non-athletes with CLBP compared to healthy individuals.Cho et al. [
16
] propose that the risk for LBP and its severity would be associated with
isokinetic weakness and the isometric weakness of trunk flexors and extensors.
From this, it is necessary to consider the importance of measuring these parameters in
patients with ALBP, which could be used as an indicator of functionality or prognosis in
these subjects, since isokinetic dynamometry has been widely used to evaluate the trunkstrength but in patients with CLBP [
50
–
53
]; however, few studies have evaluated patients
with ALBP.
Based on this systematic review,  we cannot recommend reference values for the
strength of trunk flexors and extensors in subjects with ALBP due to the high risk of biasof the articles included and the diversity of protocols, instruments and variables used ineach article. Although three [
44
–
46
] of the four studies reviewed report differences in some
strength parameters between individuals with ALBP and healthy subjects, these data arenot confident given the limited quality of the evidence. Thus, it was also not possible to
139

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health
2021
,
18
, 2576
determine whether strength levels can help us distinguish between patients with ALBPand healthy subjects. On the other hand, we did not identify any studies that comparedeccentric strength among these people. The eccentric contraction occurs when the externalforce is greater than the muscle strength, therefore, it plays an important role in the activitiesof daily life and sports, in the deceleration of the body during movements [
54
], so it would
be interesting to investigate different types of contraction and eccentric/concentric ratio insubjects with ALBP compared to healthy subjects to understand the muscle dynamics ofthe trunk in different contexts or activities.
We can consider this review’s strength as having considered research with no prior
date limit until 2020.  However, that presents us with an associated difficulty since thestudies we include have a range of 36 years of difference, time in which the standardsof scientific publication have changed, and new guidelines have been developed [
55
,
56
],
which could explain the high risk of bias found in this review.
In this context, it is necessary to conduct rigorous longitudinal studies, based on cur-
rent methodological guidelines, that allow us to detect people at risk for developing ALBPand that consider the multiple aspects involved in LBP, both physical and psychological.For this reason, we can suggest the formation of working groups to determine consensus onthe best way to approach the evaluation of this type of patient. For the reasons mentionedearlier, we consider it necessary to carry out new studies of high methodological qualitythat allow us to clarify if there are levels of strength associated with ALBP and to be ableto prevent its appearance.  In addition, given the questions regarding the evaluation ofunnatural movements or those that do not necessarily represent the physiology or velocityof the movement performed on the isokinetic dynamometer [
57
], it is necessary to develop
new technologies [
28
,
58
] that allow the evaluation of trunk strength related to a functional
or athletic context that mimics the functional demands of the athlete or patient.5. Conclusions
The findings of this systematic review indicate that the quality of studies assessing
isokinetic trunk strength in subjects with ALBP compared to healthy controls was weak.Moreover, the available data did not allow presentation of reference values in patients
with ALBP. Future research of high methodological quality is needed to establish reference
values of trunk isokinetic strength in subjects with ALBP and to determine the ability of
trunk strength to discriminate ALBP patients from healthy individuals.Supplementary Materials:

Abstract:
Background: To evaluate and synthesize the existing evidence of the effects of practicing
martial  arts  by  cancer  patients  and  cancer  survivors  in  relation  to  overall  quality  of  life  (QoL)and cancer-related fatigue (CRF). Methods:  Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from 1 January2000 to
5 November 20
20 investigating the impact of martial arts were compared with any control
intervention for overall QoL and CRF among cancer patients and survivors. Publication quality andrisk of bias were assessed using the Cochrane handbook of systematic reviews. Results: According tothe electronic search, 17 RCTs were retrieved including 1103 cancer patients. Martial arts significantlyimproved social function, compared to that in the control group (SMD =
−
0.88, 95% CI:
−
1.36,
−
0.39;
p
= 0.0004). Moreover, martial arts significantly improved functioning, compared to the control group
(SMD = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.39–0.96;
p
< 0.00001). Martial arts significantly reduced CRF, compared to that
in the control group (SMD =
−
0.51, 95% CI:
−
0.80,
−
0.22;
p
= 0.0005, I2 > 95%). Conclusions: The
results of our systematic review and meta-analysis reveal that the effects of practicing martial arts onCRF and QoL in cancer patients and survivors are inconclusive. Some potential effects were seenfor social function and CRF, although the results were inconsistent across different measurementmethods. There is a need for larger and more homogeneous clinical trials encompassing differentcancer types and specific martial arts disciplines to make more extensive and definitive cancer- andsymptom-specific recommendations.Keywords:

1. Introduction
In 2020, 19.3 million new cancer cases were diagnosed globally, where breast, lung,
and prostate were the most frequent type of malignancies [
1
]. Cancer is the second cause
of mortality worldwide after ischemic heart disease, with 8.97 million deaths, and it is
predicted to become the leading cause of death by 2060 with approximately 18.63 million
deaths [
2
]. Improvements in diagnostics and treatments have increased the survival rate
of the most prevalent cancers in developed countries [
3
]. As of January 2019, there were
an estimated 16.9 million cancer survivors in the United States.  The number of cancersurvivors is projected to increase to 22.2 million by 2030 [
4
]. Furthermore, the burden of
cancer incidence and survivors continues to increase in low- and middle-income countriesas well [
5
].
The physical, emotional, and financial impacts of cancer diagnosis and its manage-
ment, along with the side effects of treatments, normally have long-term consequences

on the patient’s overall quality of life (QoL) that can interfere in their activities of dailyliving [
6
,
7
]. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines QoL as an individual’s per-
ception of their position in life in the context of the culture, as well as the value systems
in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards, and concerns [
8
].
Cancer-specific QoL encompasses all stages of the disease [
9
].
Cancer standard treatment (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, tar-
geted therapy, and immunotherapy) can cause a series of side effects, including nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, fatigue, depression, and weight loss, which affects phys-
ical and psychological functioning, as well as overall QoL [
10
–
12
]. Fatigue remains one
of the most important components of QoL that can vary in intensity and impact basedon the stage of disease, treatment received, and patients’ functional status [
13
].  Cancer-
related fatigue (CRF) seems to be due mainly to alterations promoted by cancer in patienthomeostasis, such as proinflammatory cytokine upregulations, hydroxytryptophan dysreg-ulation, hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis dysfunction, circadian rhythm disturbances,and increased vagal tone. It is also shown that CRF can vary based on the cancer type [
14
].
The CRF is defined as a distressing, persistent, and subjective sense of physical, emotional,
and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not
proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning [
15
]. Moreover, it can
lead to a decrease in the participation of activities of daily living and impairment of the
patient mood; moreover, it is an important predictor of reduced overall QoL [
16
,
17
]. The
CRF has been estimated to affect between 25% and 99% of cancer patients and depends onseveral factors, including patient population, type of treatment received, and assessmentmethod, which can persist for five or more years after cancer diagnosis [
18
].
Several interventions, such as exercise, heat, cryotherapy, or manual therapy, can be
followed to ameliorate some of the above-mentioned side effects and improve QoL [
19
].
Different exercise programs offer benefits and are safe in cancer patients during and aftercancer treatment [
20
], improving health and functional outcomes in these patients [
21
].
National guidelines recommend the prescription of exercise to cancer patients; however,it should be tailored to their needs and capabilities [
22
]. This physical activity has to be
done 3–5 times/week and for at least 20 min to be effective and should involve aerobic,
resistance exercises, or a combination of both [
23
].
Martial arts present several benefits to those who practice them. The benefits include
physical and psychological aspects, including lessening negative emotional reactions, en-
hancing balance, and improving cardiovascular and musculoskeletal fitness [
24
]. Although
there is limited evidence of studies with limited number of participants assessing theeffects of practicing martial arts in cancer patients [
25
–
27
], there is a need to clarify their
effects on CRF and QoL. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to comprehen-sively review the use of martial arts among cancer survivors and its impact on QoL andCRF. Furthermore, it was attempted to determine the benefits of these types of programs,identify the strengths and gaps in the evidence, and suggest directions to overcome thehighlighted limitations.2. Materials and Methods
Cochrane’s handbook of systematic reviews of interventions and the Preferred Report-
ing Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement were utilized inthis study to develop and perform this systematic review and meta-analysis [
28
].
2.1. Literature Search
Online databases, including PubMed (Medline), Cochrane Web, Web of Science, and
Scopus, were searched from 1 January 2000 to 5 November 2020 using the keywords:
(Martial Arts OR Hap Ki Do OR Judo OR Karate OR Jujitsu OR Tae Kwon Do OR Aikido
OR Wushu OR Kung Fu OR Gong Fu OR Gongfu) AND (Cancer* OR Neoplasm* OR
Tumor* OR Malignancy*). Furthermore, the search was continued for PubMed (Medline),
which was then formatted to perform the search in other databases.

2.2. Eligibility Criteria
Following the PICO principles (patient, intervention, control, and outcomes) [
29
], the
inclusion criteria were: (a) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated cancer
patients with the primary intervention of martial arts and compared with any comparator
for QoL and fatigue; (b) original articles in peer reviewed journals; and (c) eligible studiesin English. Non-randomized or any other trials rather than RCTs, non-English RCTs, trialsthat did not assess the QoL or CRF, non-human studies, studies with no full text, singlearm studies, and reviews and secondary works were excluded from this study.2.3. Screening of Results
Initially, two authors (D.S. and S.S.) screened all titles and abstracts using the inclusion
criteria. Subsequently, they coded the abstracts as “yes” for inclusion in full text-reviewand “no” for excluding the abstract. If both authors coded an abstract as “yes”, they wereconsidered for full text review. If both were coded as no, they were excluded. For abstracts
where there were discrepancies, the decision was made through either mutual discussion
or with the help of a third reviewer (S.A). In the next stage, a full text review of all articles
was performed against the inclusion criteria. Following that, the full text was read carefully
for eligibility criteria.2.4. Data Extraction
The extracted data were divided into three categories.  The first one was baseline
characteristics, including author name, country, sample size, age, gender, marital status,
and cancer treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, as well as author name). Thesecond contained the key characteristics of the included studies, such as country, cancertype, the timing of intervention, duration of the intervention (sessions, frequency, and
period), and outcomes. The last one was outcome measures, including: (I) quality of life by
European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Question-naire (EORTC QLQ-C30) [
30
], Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy—General (FACT-
G) [
31
], and The Short-Form 36 (SF-36) [
32
]; and (II) fatigue by The Brief Fatigue Inventory
(BFI) [
33
], Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy—Fatigue (FACIT-F) [
34
], and
the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory—Short Form (MFSI-SF) [
35
,
36
].
2.5. Quality Assessment
The quality of this meta-analysis was judged based on the Grading of Recommenda-
tions, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) guideline [
37
]. GRADE is a
transparent and reproducible system that allows the researcher to grade the quality andcertainty of the evidence. Based on the quality of the evidence, the level of confidence wasassessed that an estimate of the effect could be correct.  Following that, two researchers
(D.S. and S.S.) evaluated each study. An overall quality score was assigned to each study,
ranging from high, moderate, low, to very low grade of evidence.  These grades meanthe grade certainty/quality of the evidence of the studies.  If there was any uncertaintybetween the two independent researchers, a third researcher (S.A.) evaluated the evidenceto obtain the conclusion. The risk of bias of the included studies was also evaluated usingthe Cochrane’s risk of bias tool [
38
].  This tool was used to evaluate the RCTs regarding
randomization tools; concealment of allocation; blinding of assessors, participants, and
personnel; and selective reporting, attrition, and other biases.  No paper evaluated was
excluded from the results because of low quality or high risk of bias.2.6. Statistical Analysis
The data were analyzed as a standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence
interval (CI) under a random-effects model using the inverse-variance method in the Re-
view Manager Software (version 5.3, The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark)
package. The heterogeneity was considered when I-square test (I2) and Chi-Square P were
more and less than 50% and 0.1, respectively [
38
–
40
].

3. Results3.1. Search Results and Summary of Included Studies
Our electronic search retrieved 801 records, 744 of which underwent title and abstract
screening after removal of duplicates.  Out of these, 38 records progressed for full-textscreening, and 21 of them were excluded from the study. Finally, 17 RCTs were includedfor further analysis [
41
–
57
]. Figure
1
illustrates the study selection process. These studies
included a total of 1103 cancer patients who were divided into control groups (
n
= 546) and
treatment groups with martial arts (
n
= 557). The mean age of the included cancer patients
was 58
±
3.1 years. The baseline characteristics and summary of the included studies are
shown in Tables
1
and
2
.
3.2. Description of Intervention
Most of the studies analyzed martial arts, such as Tai Chi and Qigong, in one of the
comparator arms.  They compared the effect of martial arts with standard care, control,
psychosocial support, strength training, and even dance. Tai Chi is a traditional Chinese
martial art used for defense as well as for its health benefits [
58
]. Tai Chi and its derivates
(Tai Chi Chih, Tai Chi Chuan, Tai Chi Qi Qong, and Tai Chi Easy) are efficient complemen-
tary approaches used in improving wellbeing and fatigue [
59
].  Qigong is considered a
form of Chinese martial arts with benefits in immune regulation, balancing the “qi”, andstrengthening muscles and tendons [
60
]. These traditional martial arts forms involved med-
itation, breathing techniques, coordinating the movements, and relaxation exercises [
61
].
Another martial art used in the clinical trials was Kyoshu Jitsu. This martial art focuses on
pressure points for self-defense as well as its benefits for healing [
53
]. The majority of the
studies analyzed for this meta-analysis focused on breast cancer. Only a small number of
studies considered other tumor types, such as lymphoma, ovary, colon, lung, prostate, andnasopharyngeal cancer (Tables
1
and
2
).

3.3. Outcomes
In total, three studies [
43
,
50
,
53
] assessed QoL using the European Organization for
Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). A
pooled analysis compared the impact of martial arts vs.  no intervention among cancerpatients  and  showed  no  significant  improvement  in  global  health,  (SMD  =  1.30,  95%
CI:
−
1.18, 3.78;
p
= 0.30, I2 > 95%), physical function (SMD = 0.84, 95% CI:
−
1.42–3.10;
p
= 0.47, I2 > 95%), role function (SMD = 1.03, 95% CI:
−
1.01–3.08];
p
= 0.32, I2 > 95%),
emotional function (SMD = 1.37, 95% CI:
−
1.12–3.85;
p
= 0.28, I2 > 95%), cognitive function
(SMD = 1.37, 95% CI:
−
0.82–3.55];
p
= 0.22, I2 > 95%), and social function (SMD = 1.17, 95%
CI:
−
0.99–3.34;
p
= 0.29, I2 > 95%) (Figure
2
). It should be noted that the heterogeneity was
solved after excluding the study by Chuang (2017) [
43
](
p
> 0.1), and the results remained
non-significant (Figure
A1
).

3.4. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General
In total, five studies [
42
,
46
,
51
,
54
,
55
] reported the effect of martial arts on QoL by
FACT-G. Pooled data show non-significant improvement between the groups in terms
of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy—General (SMD = 0.34, 95% CI:
−
0.02–
0.70];
p
= 0.06) (Figure
3
).  The analysis was heterogeneous (
p
= 0.04, I2 = 61%), and the
heterogeneity was solved when removing the study by Oh (2009) [
51
](
p
= 0.70, I2 = 0%). The
results remained non-significant (SMD = 0.16, 95% CI:
−
0.11–0.43;
p
= 0.25) (Figure
A2
).
Figure 3.

3.5. The Short-Form 36 (SF-36)
The Short-Form 36 (SF-36) was reported in three studies [
41
,
45
,
52
].  The combined
SMD between martial art and control groups showed non-significant results regarding
physical function (SMD = 0.16, 95% CI:
−
0.18–0.50;
p
= 0.36), mental health (SMD = 0.05,
95% CI:
−
0.27–0.36;
p
= 0.77), and social function (SMD = 0.07, 95% CI:
−
1.87–2.01;
p
= 0.94).
It is worth noting that the results of physical function and mental health were homogeneous
(
p
= 0.33, I2 = 10% and
p
= 0.95, I2 = 0%, respectively) (Figure
4
).  However, the social
function was heterogeneous (
p
< 0.00001, I2 = 97%), and the heterogeneity was solved by
excluding the study by Larkey (2016) [
45
](
p
= 0.47, I2 = 0%). The results after sensitivity
analysis show that martial arts significantly reduced social function compared to the controlgroup (SMD =
−
0.88, 95% CI:
−
1.36,
−
0.39];
p
= 0.0004) (Figure
A3
).
3.6. The Brief Fatigue Inventory
Pooled data of three studies [
42
,
43
,
47
] report that the BFI showed no significant reduc-
tion of fatigue between the two groups (SMD =
−
1.04, 95% CI:
−
2.96–0.87;
p
= 0.29). Accord-
ing to the results, the analysis was heterogeneous (
p
< 0.00001, I2 = 98%)
(Figure
5
)
. Further-
more, the heterogeneity was solved after removing the study by Chuang (2017) [
43
](
p
= 0.24,
I2 = 26%),  and the results remained non-significant (SMD = 0.01,  95% C
I:
−
0.39–0.41
;
p
= 0.96) (Figure
A4
).
3.7. Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue
Totally, three studies [
48
,
49
,
51
] reported the use of Functional Assessment of Chronic
Illness Therapy—Fatigue (FACIT-F). The results show martial arts significantly improvedfatigue,  compared  to  the  control  group  (SMD  =  0.68,  95%  CI:  0.39–0.96;
p
<  0.00001).
According to the results, the data are homogeneous (
p
= 0.73, I2 = 0%) (Figure
6
).
3.8. The Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form
The multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory—Short Form was used in three
studies [
44
,
56
,
57
]. The results reveal that the SMD between martial art and control groups
was non-significant (SMD =
−
0.31, 95% CI:
−
0.71–0.10;
p
= 0.14), and the data are het-
erogeneous (
p
= 0.06, I2 = 64%) (Figure
7
).  Furthermore, the heterogeneity was solved
after excluding the study by Irwin (2017) [
44
](
p
= 0.92, I2 = 0%), and the results show that
152

, 6116
martial arts significantly reduced fatigue, compared to the control group (SMD =
−
0.51,
95% CI:
−
0.80,
−
0.22];
p
= 0.0005) (Figure

4. Discussion
Cancer patients are encouraged to participate in an exercise program during and
following treatment [
15
]; however, there are still gaps related to regimes and forms of
exercise appropriate for each individual.  Improvement of QoL in cancer patients and
management of their CRF have gained importance in recent years to enhance the general
wellbeing of cancer patients and ameliorate the side effects of cancer therapies [
62
]. Multiple
studies have covered the role of physical activity and exercise studying their effects onQoL and CRF of cancer patients during and after standard cancer treatment [
63
]. In this
regard, martial arts have gained popularity in western countries as a new form of physicalactivity. In addition, martial arts combine musculoskeletal conditioning and training incognitive skills, together with breathing exercises, which are typically delivered in grouptraining sessions that also provide social support for cancer patients [
24
]. The results of the
benefits of martial arts on QoL and CRF have been reported in several studies with a limited
number of participants covering limited martial arts disciplines and cancer types [
41
–
57
].
This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis grouping martial arts and their
effects on QoL and CRF as a primary intervention in cancer patients during and aftertreatment, regardless of the cancer type and treatment received. The data extracted fromdifferent studies of cancer patients practicing martial arts show a significant improvementof social function measured through SF-36 and a significant reduction of CRF measuredusing FACIT-F and MFSI-SF. The effects reported on social function by Campo et al. [
41
]
and Sprod et al. [
52
] were positive but modest in their studied population. Social function
is an important dimension for cancer patients since the disease and its treatment can affectdiverse aspects, such as marital relationships, parental responsibilities, work environment,and social activities [
64
]. Regarding the significant reduction of CRF using the FACIT-F
assessment scale, Oh et al.  found a significant difference in their study of breast can-cer survivors practicing Tai Chi Chuan for 60 min, 3 times per week, for 12 weeks [
51
].
Mustian et al.
found a non-significant positive effect on fatigue measured by the same tool
in breast cancer survivors practicing Tai Chi, possibly due to the small number of partici-
pants in their studies [
48
,
49
]. Considering the CRF measured through the MFSI-SF scale,
Zhou et al. found a significant reduction of CRF in nasopharyngeal patients undergoingradiotherapy after practicing Tai chi for 60 min, 5 times per week, for 8 months [
57
].  In
line with these results, another study found that lung cancer patients who followed a
Tai Chi program of 60 min every other day for 12 weeks and underwent chemotherapy
had a significant reduction of CRF, compared to those who were in a low-impact exercise
program. This reduction was observed after 6 and 12 weeks of the program initiation [
56
].
Other outcomes analyzed in this meta-analysis did not reach a significant difference, evenafter heterogeneity was solved.

In the articles analyzed by our team, most of the patients in the trials were breast
cancer patients who finished their treatment and started a program for physical activity orare undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The trials analyzed had small batches of
patients enrolled and the population was too heterogeneous for us to be able to conclude
about the optimal load and specifics of exercises.  Furthermore, most of the martial artssessions presented ranged from a period of 3 weeks to 24 weeks of practice, with a normalsession being 40–60 min.  The schedule of the sessions was from 2 weekly classes to 12
weekly classes depending on the type of martial arts. Taking into account the results of
the analyzed trials, we consider that practicing martial arts is safe and recommended for
patients undergoing treatment as well as for cancer survivors at the completion of their
oncological therapy
Other meta-analyses have reviewed the effects of martial arts in QoL and/or CRF
[
64
,
65
]
.
Tao et al. in a study analyzed the effects of acupuncture, Tuina, Tai Chi, Qigong, and tra-
ditional Chinese music therapy on symptom management and QoL in cancer patients.
According to the results, Tai Chi and Qigong had no effect on QoL or CRF in breast cancer
survivors [
65
]. Wayne et al. also analyzed the effects of Tai Chi and Qigong in cancer sur-
vivors, finding a significant improvement in CRF, sleep difficulty, depression, and overall
QoL, as well as a non-significant trend in pain control [
66
].
Albeit all the evidence points to the benefits of physical activity in cancer patients,
these changes to increase their physical activity seem harder to implement by cancer
patients [
67
]. Martial arts have been demonstrated in several studies to be a feasible option
for cancer patients [
41
,
53
].  Moreover, they may reduce some of the negative effects of
cancer and improve physical as well as psychological health [
68
].  This study may help
healthcare professionals involved in cancer management and patients decide to choose anactivity to improve QoL and reduce CRF. Martial arts offer a wide variety of disciplines
with different levels of intensity that would allow cancer patients the possibility of deciding
the activity that fits better with their needs.
Different guidelines covering CRF, such as NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer
Network) guidelines, focused on CRF [
15
], and the guidelines from the Oncology Nursing
Society  “Putting  Evidence  into  Practice”  [
69
]  proposed  exercise  and  physical  activity
as a first-line intervention for CRF. Other interventions,  in addition to erythropoiesis-
stimulating agents and low-dose dexamethasone, do not offer effectiveness reducing CRFin patients with cancer [
69
]. The beneficial effects of martial arts in QoL of cancer patients
can be due to the relaxation response and the immunomodulatory [
50
,
70
] and hormonal
effects [
71
].  A recent meta-analysis has shown that Tai Chi has an impact on reducing
cortisol levels in breast cancer survivors. The same study showed an impact on physicaland mental health, improving limb-muscular function and promoted sleep [
72
].
There is some evidence showing that CRF and QoL are not improved only by physical
exercises [
73
,
74
], supporting the concept that a more holistic approach should be considered
in order to benefit these outcomes in cancer patients. Adverse effects due to martial arts
practice did not exist in several studies [
42
,
49
,
51
].
Meta-analyses allow overcoming several limitations.  First, pooling the data from
different studies allows correcting the statistical limitation of the small sample data of
some of the analyzed studies. Another strength is that meta-analyses allow detecting theheterogeneity existing in different studies that used martial arts as a primary interventionin cancer patients.   It also helps settle the effect from conflicting results coming fromdifferent studies.
Regarding the limitations of this study, one can refer to the analysis of only studies
that were published in English. This fact excludes the articles written in other languagesthat could represent the evidence better and make more general conclusions.  Second,the diversity of the outcomes measured in the studies analyzed in this meta-analysismade the task of comparison arduous. Future studies should report outcomes in a morehomogeneous way in order to be able to pool all available data. Another limitation is thatthe majority of the studies analyzed were performed on breast cancer survivors, limiting
156

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health
2021
,
18
, 6116
the conclusions drawn in this study to this group of patients. Accordingly, future studiesinvolving the investigation of the effects on QoL and CRF of martial arts in cancer patientsshould cover other cancer types. In that way, it would be possible to stratify the resultsby cancer types and other variables, such as age or other interesting conditions, includinggender or grade of disability, which could help tailor the interventions to the patients’needs. In addition, the control groups analyzed were very heterogeneous, and this couldbe a source of heterogeneity of this study. Another limitation comes from the fact that theanalyzed studies covered broad inclusion criteria related to how fatigue was evaluated inthose patients enrolled. Finally, some limitations are due to the sample size of the studiesand the fact that the patients in some cases were not homogenously under cancer treatment,limitations that are intrinsic to the scarce available data in this regard.
Future studies should address the limitations existing in previous trials. Sample size
was an issue in several trials, not providing enough statistical power to draw significant
observations.   Furthermore,  martial arts should be studied in more cancer types,  and
patients should be stratified in order to be able to extract cancer- and population-specific
conclusions. Moreover, trials should try to overcome a common issue where neither the
participants nor the instructors or investigators were blinded to the condition against drug
trial recommendations. Another limitation was related to the selection bias found in severalof the analyzed studies. Longer intervention periods should be followed in order to see ifthe interventions have effects on cancer survivors.5. Conclusions
The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis reveal that the effects of prac-
ticing martial arts on CRF and QoL in cancer patients and survivors are inconclusive.
Although some potential effects were seen for social function and CRF, the results are incon-
sistent across different measurement methods. Therefore, larger and more homogeneousclinical trials encompassing different cancer types and specific martial arts disciplines areneeded before definitive cancer- and symptom-specific recommendations can be made.
