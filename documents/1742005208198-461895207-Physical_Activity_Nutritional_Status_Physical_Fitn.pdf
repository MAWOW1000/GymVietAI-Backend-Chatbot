Preface to ”Physical Activity, Nutritional Status,Physical Fitness”
The Special Issue “Physical fitness,  nutritional status,  physical activity” is mainly devoted to
the environment of uniformed services.  This is justified by the strong correlation between nationalsecurity and the fitness of soldiers and tactical athletes.  It is a fact that the ability to make physicaleffort  is  an  important  factor  enabling  the  performance  of  official  tasks  by  soldiers  and  officers  ofuniformed services. The level of physical fitness depends on the level of physical activity and propernutritional status.  Knowledge of the relationship between physical fitness and physical activity andnutritional status is essential for physical education specialists, military doctors, as well as soldiers,policemen, and border guards. This Special Issue is especially targeted at these people.
The first five articles mainly refer to the physical activity and nutritional status of Polish soldiers,
policemen,  and  border  guards.   These  works  were  carried  out  as  part  of  a  research  project  of  theNational Health Program.  The Special Issue also includes articles on overweight and obesity in thecivilian environment.  There are also two articles on the physical fitness of athletes (kickboxers) andAmerican soldiers.
This  Special  Issue,  titled  ”Physical  fitness,  nutritional  status,  physical  activity”,  is  the  result
of the work of scientists from Poland, the USA, Ireland, Germany, and the Netherlands.  They arerecognized specialists in their scientific disciplines. At this point, I would like to thank the authors ofthe articles and reviewers whose valuable comments contributed to the high substantive level of thepublished articles.

Abstract:
Level of physical activity positively affects health condition, correlates highly with level of
physical fitness and contributes to the efficient performance of military tasks. The aim of the study
was to assess the level of physical activity and body mass index of the Polish Air Force soldiers. A
total of 543 professional soldiers (men) doing military service in military units of the Polish Air Forceunderwent the examination. The average age of examined soldiers amounted to 34.8
±
9.0 years. In
order to carry out the research, the long version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire
was used. Out of the total of 477 questionnaires that qualified for the analysis, a high level of physical
activity was found among 81.1% of subjects, moderate 10.5% and low 8.4%. Average MET values
were obtained in the following:  job-related, relocation (transportation), housekeeping, recreation
(leisure activities and sport).  The average MET values were 4173
±
5306 MET; 2371
±
2725 MET;
2455
±
4843 MET; 2421
±
2802 MET, respectively. The average level of body mass index amounted
to 25.98
±

.  The tested Air Force soldiers were generally characterized by a high and
moderate level of physical activity. Generally, there was no difference in the level of physical activitybetween the flight crew and the ground staff.Keywords:

1. Introduction
It is generally believed that level of physical activity (PA) largely reflects state of
health, as reflected in the saying “healthy body, healthy mind”. Numerous studies have
proven that, among other things, lack of physical activity contributes to the occurrence
and development of many diseases [
1
–
4
]. Therefore, much attention is paid to promoting
physical activity and pro-health lifestyles in society for everyone, from children to olderpeople.   Deficiencies in  physical  activity caused  by  civilization  should be  reduced  by
conscious participation in physical activities.
In the uniformed services, a high level of physical fitness is very desirable in the
aspects of professional preparation and efficient fulfilling of service tasks (e.g., a soldieron the battlefield,  a policeman during an intervention or a firefighter during a rescueoperation) [
5
,
6
]. The way to achieve the desired level of physical fitness for a soldier (an
officer of a particular formation) is participation in various forms of physical activity during

work and leisure time. This should be reflected in a high level of physical activity. Soldiers,
as part of their professional work, should participate in obligatory physical educationclasses, diversified by the number of hours depending on military specialty [
7
].
The group of soldiers in the Air Force includes soldiers of various specialties, most of
which specialties are also in both the Navy and the Land Forces. These specialties are, for
example, administration or logistics. Even such specialties as ground service of aviationequipment (engineering and aviation service) occurs in other branches of armed forces. Inthe Air Force there are particular specialties typical of military air services, like that of asupersonic airplane pilot. There is the main division of the flight crew and ground staff.
The main differences are the environment of performing official tasks (air, land) and the
way of logging in to perform them [
8
]. These differences also apply to physical preparation,
in terms of the volume of classes and means of physical education (i.e., physical exercises).
In the literature, we can find many papers on the physical fitness of soldiers [
9
–
11
]. So
far, not much work has been published regarding the assessment of the physical activitylevel of Polish soldiers, and those from other countries. In Poland, comparative researchhas been conducted among soldiers of military administration, special units, soldiers ofthe Land Forces Training Center, soldiers of the Land Forces and among soldiers of thespecial unit of the Military Police, and there have been assessments of physical activitylevel carried out among candidates seeking to become professional soldiers [
12
–
16
].  In
general,  a high level of physical activity was revealed for soldiers.   However,  a small
percentage of soldiers also revealed a low level of it, which is not a good predictor of
efficient performance of service duties.  Mierzejewski conducted research on the levelof physical activity among soldiers of land troops qualified for the Officer’s Study.  He
stated that 79.0% of the respondents presented a high level of physical activity and 21.0%a moderate level [
14
]. In turn, Tomczak et al. conducted research using the International
Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) tool among Polish soldiers of the Military Police.Based on the research, they found that 84.6% of the respondents were characterized by ahigh level of physical activity, 7.7% were moderate, and 7.7% were low [
15
]. Comparative
research on the physical activity among soldiers of the National Reserve Force was carriedout by Szettler-Degler [
17
]. She concluded that the level of metabolic equivalent (MET) was
similar between men and women.  Ły
 ̇
zwi  ́
nski, on the basis of his own study, found that
80.0% of the surveyed Polish soldiers of the land forces perceived there to be a relationshipbetween physical fitness and better performance of official tasks.  More than half of therespondents revealed that they undertook physical activity outside of business hours andthat they assessed their physical fitness as very good [
13
].  In many works, attention is
paid to the need to raise awareness of the necessity to undertake physical activity and to
motivate people to undertake physical activity [
15
,
18
,
19
].
The main aim of the research presented here was to assess the level of physical activity
and the body mass index (BMI) of soldiers of the Polish Air Force. The specific objectives
were to identify differences in the levels of physical activity and BMI between flight crew
and ground staff and age groups (up to 30 years of age, 31–40 years of age and a groupover 40).  We hypothesized that the flight crew would reveal a higher level of physicalactivity than ground staff and that a higher level of physical activity would be presented by
younger soldiers. Our hypothesis regarding flight crew versus ground staff was justified by
the fact that flight crew participate in more compulsory physical education and recreationclasses than other soldiers.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Study Design and Participations
A total of 543 professional soldiers (men) doing military service in military units of
the Polish Air Force underwent the examination.  The subjects were selected randomly.
The soldiers performed professional military service in 35 military units of the Air Force.The research sample accounted for about 3% of the population of soldiers of the Air Force.The average age of examined soldiers amounted to 34.8
±
9.0 (19–59) years old.  Due to

, 8392
the failure to meet the criteria of credibility, 66 questionnaires did not qualify for furtherstudies. The percentage of questionnaires that qualified for the analysis was 87.8%.
The  results  of  the  research  were  presented  in  two  basic  groups,  i.e.,  flight  crew
37.49
±
7.54 (21–59) years old and ground staff 32.70
±
9.57 (19–59) years old. The flight
crew included military pilots, on-board technicians, and on-board navigators, whereasthe ground staff included ground service of the aircraft, engineers, technicians, and staffsoldiers. The justification for such division was the environment of performing main officialtasks (flight crew—in the air; ground staff—on the ground).  Subsequently, the researchmaterial was divided into the following age groups: up to 30 years old, 31–40 years oldand a group over 40 years old. The age of the respondents was determined based on dateof birth.
The research was carried out in 2017–2018 as part of the National Health Program
research project.  The permission of the Bioethics Committee of the Military Institute of
Hygiene and Epidemiology in Warsaw (Poland) was obtained for conducting the research
(No 01/2016).  All procedures were performed in accordance with the ethical standards
as laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments or comparableethical standards. All participants provided informed consent.2.2. Physical Activity Assessment
In order to carry out the research, the long version of IPAQ was used.  In the intro-
duction to the questionnaire a vigorous physical activity and moderate physical activity
were defined in a way accessible for everybody. Vigorous physical activity is understood as
heavy physical exercise that forces strong, increased breathing, and, therefore, acceleratedheart rate.  Moderate physical activity is understood as an average effort with slightlyincreased breathing and a little accelerated heart action [
20
,
21
]. The first part of the ques-
tionnaire dealt with physical efforts related to professional work (Part 1: Job-related PA).
Three types of efforts were distinguished, i.e., vigorous, moderate and walking. The second
part dealt with physical efforts related to relocating (walking, cycling; Part 2: Transporta-
tion (relocation) physical activity).  In the third part, subjects were asked about the timethey spent on taking physical activity related to housework, general housekeeping and forfamily care (Part 3: Housework, house maintenance, and caring for family). The fourth partof the questionnaire was connected with recreation, sport and physical activity in leisuretime (Part 4: Recreation, sport, and leisure-time physical activity). The fifth part contained
questions related to time spent sitting, divided into weekend and week days (Part 5: Time
spent sitting).
Based on the number of days, time spent on given physical activity and MET rate
determined for a given physical activity, a total energy expenditure for each type of physicalexercise was calculated. 1 MET corresponds to the average energy expenditure during rest
(in a sitting position). It is equivalent to the consumption of oxygen in a sitting position of
a person weighing 70 kg, which is 3.5 mL O
2
/min/kg [
22
].
2.3. Somatic Measurements
The measurement of basic morphological features was based on the analysis of the
following values of somatic measurements, which were measured according to the Martintechnique, body height, and body mass [
23
]. Body height was measured with an anthro-
pometer (Holtain, UK) to the nearest 1 mm, in a standing upright position, without shoes.
Body mass was measured using a Charder MS 4202L electronic weight floor scale (measure-ment accuracy < 50 g). Each measurement was performed under the same test conditions
(in the morning, about 30 min before the first meal). The respondent was wearing sports
clothes and barefoot. The same measuring equipment was used during all stages of theresearch, the accuracy of which was checked periodically. Measurements were made by
people who graduated in physical education.

Based on these data, the BMI was calculated (BMI = body mass/height
2
[kg/m
2
]).
The scale of BMI classification reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) was
accepted [
24
].
2.4. Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were means (
±
standard deviations), medians, quartiles 1 and
3, as well as interquartile range. Normality checks were done with the Shapiro–Wilk test.
To compare groups, we used the Mann–Whitney test, as well as the Kruskall-Wallis test.The Chi-square test, to relate nominal data, and the Spearman correlation, and its 95% CI,
were also used.  Effect sizes were calculated (partial eta square, and Cramer’s V). These
analyses were done in Statistica v.13.3 (Statsoft, Krak
ó
w, Poland), and the significance level
was set at 5%. Further sample size estimation was done with the G*Power v. 3.1. software
(Heinrich-Heine-Universität, Düsseldorf, Germany).
3. Results
The calculations using the G*Power test were made a posteriori. The minimum sample
size should be 220 subjects for the Chi-square test (effect size = 0.3; power = 0.95).  Theminimum sample size should be 252 subjects for the Kruskal–Wallis test (effect size = 0.25;
power = 0.95).  In our research we met these requirements with a significant surplus, as
477 questionnaires were qualified for the analysis.
Out of the total of 477 questionnaires which qualified for the analysis, a high level of
physical activity was found among 81.8% (
n
= 390) of subjects, a moderate level in 10.2%
(
n
= 50) and low in 8.0% (
n
= 40). Taking into account only the flight crew, it was found that
a high level of physical activity characterized 80.9% of the soldiers, moderate 11.9%, andlow 7.2%. In the ground staff, the following results were obtained: 82.4%, 9.0% and 8.6%,respectively (Table
1
).

presents the results of the Chi-square test for the levels of physical activity
depending on the type of specialization and the age of the respondents.  The analysisshowed  no  association  between  specialization  and  the  level  of  physical  activity.   The
relationship between age and the level of physical activity among flight crew also turnedout to be insignificant. A significant association of low strength was noted between the levelof physical activity and the age of ground staff. In the age group under 30, the percentageof soldiers with a high level of physical activity was significantly higher than in the othertwo age groups (90.0% vs. 78.3% and 75.4%). The percentage of soldiers up to 30 years ofage with a low level of physical activity was significantly lower than among soldiers aged31–40 (2.7% vs. 14.1%).
BMI was calculated for professional role and in terms of age groups of the soldiers
(Table
2
).  The average BMI for all Air Force soldiers was 25.98 kg/m
2
, for flight crew
26.65 kg/m
2
, and for ground staff 25.46 kg/m
2
.  Normal body weight was revealed by
40.5% of all soldiers of the Air Force (flight crew 34.3%, ground staff 45.4%). Overweight
was found in 46.5% of soldiers (flight crew 46.7%, ground staff 46.4%). On the other hand,
obesity was revealed by 12.8% of all soldiers of the Air Force (flight crew19.0%, groundstaff 7.9%), while underweight was diagnosed in one soldier (ground staff). Among theflight crew, the highest percentage of soldiers with normal body weight was found insoldiers under 30 (52.2%). The highest percentage of overweight soldiers was found amongsoldiers in the 31–40 age group (56.7%). On the other hand, soldiers in the age group over40 showed the highest percentage of obesity (28.6%). The same tendency was found in thegroup of ground staff: normal body weight had the highest percentage among the youngestsoldiers (68.2%), the highest percentage of overweight soldiers was in the 31–40 age group
(58.7%), and obese soldiers were in the age group above 40 (16.9%).

In each age group of flight crew, a higher percentage of obese soldiers was found
(statistically significant difference). Statistically significant differences in BMI values were
found between the flight crew and ground staff. The following regularity was observed,BMI increases with the age of the subjects.  The highest BMI was found in the group offlight crew who were over 40 (BMI = 27.67 kg/m
2
).
In the next stage of the analysis of the research results, the total MET value, and the
MET value for individual types of physical activity, were calculated (in accordance with the
parts listed in IPAQ). It was found that the overall MET level in the group of ground staff
was higher than that of the flight crew (12,333 MET vs. 10,262 MET;
p
< 0.05). For the activity
from Part 1:  Job-related PA, a statistically significant difference in MET values betweenthe flight crew and ground staff was found (respectively: 3367 MET vs. 4807 MET). In theremaining parts of the listed activities, i.e., transportation of PA, housework, leisure-timePA, no statistically significant differences were found (Table
3
).
Table

presents the results of the studies on the total MET value for each age group.
In the group of flight crew, the highest total MET value (10,625 MET) was disclosed bysoldiers over 40.  However, in the group of ground staff, the highest MET value was forsoldiers aged 31–40 (13,045 MET). The MET values calculated for the physical activities

listed in the parts of the questionnaire (job-related PA, transportation PA, housework, leisuretime) in individual age groups were also subjected to detailed analysis
(Tables
A2
–

)
.
Taking into account the total number of Air Forces soldiers, the highest MET values related
to professional work, transportation (relocation) and housework were revealed by soldiersof the age group up to 30 (respectively: 5059 MET; 2653 MET; 2959 MET)
(Tables
A3
–
A5
)
.
Flight crew over 40 received the highest MET value related to leisure time (2559 MET)
(Table
A5
). A comparison was also made between the groups of flight crew and ground
staff, MET values for intensive efforts, MET values for moderate efforts and MET values for
walking. The flight crew obtained 3100 MET for intensive efforts, while the ground staff
attained 3900 MET. For moderate efforts, 3214 MET was obtained by the flight crew and3534 MET by the ground staff. For walking the results were, respectively: 4008 MET and4871 MET (all statistically significant differences).

There were no statistically significant differences between the surveyed groups of
soldiers in the variables “time spent sitting on a weekday” and “time spent sitting on a
weekend”. It was calculated that the flight crew spends 258 min per weekday and 211 min
per weekend sitting (ground staff: 235 min and 219 min, respectively).
In order to determine which variables had the greatest impact on BMI, correlations
were calculated and the level of statistical significance was determined. No correlationswere found in the group of All Air Force soldiers (Table
4
). Taking into account the total
number of All flight crew, a statistically very weak negative correlation was found betweenBMI and total MET, MET work, MET transportation (relocation) and walking. In the groupof ground staff only one correlation was found, between BMI and MET work (<30 years).

4. Discussion
It was hypothesized that a higher level of physical activity would be revealed by
soldiers belonging to the group of flight crew.  The premise for such a hypothesis wasthe fact that more attention is paid to physical preparation in the flight crew.  This was
manifested in an increased number of physical education classes (flight crew at least 6 h per
6

IJERPH
2022
,
19
, 8392
week, ground staff at leas
t 4 h per week), and the fact that the flight crew participated once
a year in three-week training and fitness camps [
25
].  On working days during training
and fitness camps, a minimum o
f6hof
physical education, sports and recreation classes
were carried out.  Wider educational and promotional activities in the field of a healthy
lifestyle were also undertaken in relation to the flight crew.   The Military Institute of
Aviation Medicine plays a leading role in this aspect. Based on the results of the studies,
the hypothesis was rejected. It turned out that it was the ground staff who represented ahigher level of physical activity (expressed as total MET). Another surprising result wasthe disclosure of the fact that 8% of the Air Force soldiers were classified in a group with alow level of physical activity. This is a worrying percentage as this occupational group isexpected to have a high, or at least moderate, level of physical activity. It turned out that asimilar percentage of soldiers with low levels of physical activity occurred in the group offlight crew and ground staff (7.2% and 8.6%, respectively). A similar result was obtainedby Tomczak et al. (2011) in studies conducted among military police soldiers (7.7%) [
15
]. In
turn, Mierzejewski, in the research carried out at the Land Forces Training Center, did notfind any soldier with a low level of physical activity [
14
]. This may suggest that as long as
soldiers participate in military training in barracks, they are ensured an adequate level of
physical activity by participation in varied military training. However, after returning to
military units and everyday life, the issues of physical activity become less important.
Analyzing the levels of physical activity in individual age groups, a disturbing phe-
nomenon was observed. In accordance with the general trend, it was assumed that youngersoldiers and flight crew would be characterized by a higher level of physical activity. Thisassumption was also not confirmed. Among flight crew aged up to 30, a lower percentageof soldiers with a high level of physical activity was revealed than in the age group upto 30 of ground staff (81.8% and 90.0%, respectively). The highest percentage of soldiers
with low levels of physical activity was also revealed among flight crew up to the age of 30
(9.1%) and ground staff (2.7%).
The level of physical activity is related to the value of BMI, greater physical activity is
one of the factors influencing the reduction of body mass [
26
]. Assuming the BMI criteria, all
the Air Force soldiers were revealed to be slightly overweight (25.98 kg/m
2
). BMI increased
with  the  age  of  the  respondents.   Higher  BMI  was  found  in  the  flight  crew  (Table
2
).
However, BMI should be interpreted with great caution in relation to athletes (strength
competitions), as well as physically active people who regularly practice strength exercises,because then we may have to deal with the so-called muscle overweight [
27
]. Interesting
information is provided by a comparative analysis of the currently obtained BMI results offlight crew with the results of research conducted fifteen years ago by Henrykowska and
Tomczak, also among the polish flight crew [
28
].  At that time, the level of BMI of flight
crew was 25.43 kg/m
2
, which was 1.22 units lower than at present.  For soldiers in the
group up to 30 years old, the BMI level was 23.50 kg/m
2
(it was lower by 1.55 units), for
soldiers in the group 31–40 years old, 24.41 kg/m
2
(it was lower by 1.65 units), and for the
group of soldiers over 40, 27.99 kg/m
2
(it was lower by 0.32 units) [
28
]. Definitely higher
values currently occur in the group of respondents up to the age of 30 and in the group
aged 31–40. These research results show an unfavorable trend taking place, not only in themilitary environment [
29
].
Many researchers have studied the influence of BMI level on injuries suffered by
soldiers [
30
].  There is insufficient scientific evidence for BMI in general as a modifiable
risk factor. However, there is strong scientific evidence for obesity, for being overweightand underweight, as a modifiable risk factor for musculoskeletal injuries [
31
–
33
]. It was
also found that soldiers who were older had higher BMIs, ran longer distances during unit
physical training, and had lower cardiovascular endurance as measured by the two-mile
run and were at a higher risk of a running-related injury [
33
].
A result worth analyzing is the MET value during professional work (IPAQ Part I). A
significantly higher MET value was found for the ground staff compared to the flight crew
(4807 MET and 3367 MET, respectively). The flight crew is generally believed to perform
7

IJERPH
2022
,
19
, 8392
heavier work when performing tasks in the air. However, this was not confirmed by theconducted surveys. Such a result was most likely influenced by an increase in the degree oftechnicality of military equipment and the associated change in the manner of performing
work (loads, performance of activities). As noted in the modern world, coordination skills
are more important than fitness skills [
34
,
35
]. In spite of these changes, the ground staff,
which consisted of technicians operating aircraft, performs many activities requiring effort
(moving equipment, lifting, moving as walking or cycling).
The present considerations lead to a reflection that educational errors,  related to
the promotion of a healthy lifestyle, may have occurred in military units.  Kaiser and
Sokołowski stated that the army as a total institution has a significant impact on the lifestyle
(pro-health attitudes) of soldiers. Therefore, it would be advisable to modify the existing
military school programs by taking into account the issues of health education, so that thesuperiors not only acquire command skills, but also become model health educators [
12
].
Mullie et al. (2013), on the other hand, indicated that the army, instead of relying on civilianactions in the field of public health, should develop its own specific methods of preventing
weight gain, improving physical fitness and influencing attitude to smoking [
36
].
Limitations
As stated by the Polish researchers, the respondents’ self-completion of the question-
naires led to some overestimation of the type and duration of efforts [
37
]. So, this seems
to be the biggest limitation of our research.  However, it should be emphasized that the
respondents were instructed in detail before filling in the questionnaires. When filling inthe questionnaires, the respondents had the opportunity to ask the interviewer questions.
Another limitation reported by researchers is the use of the long version of IPAQ instead
of the short version.  The respondent is forced to spend a longer time completing the
questionnaire. In our opinion, it does not seem that the time needed to complete the IPAQ
was long enough to discourage respondents from filling in the questionnaire diligently.
Moreover, the long version of the IPAQ is recommended in scientific research, especially
when one of the forms of physical activity is carefully analyzed [
38
]. In our research, we
tried to carefully analyze various forms of physical activity in different professional rolesand age groups.5. Conclusions
In general, the Air Force soldiers represented a high and moderate level of physical
activity.  However, every fifteenth respondent revealed a low level of physical activity.
There were no differences in the level of physical activity between flight crew and ground
staff. Moreover, the BMI of the examined soldiers indicated overweight tendencies, and acomparative analysis with the results of research from many years ago revealed that thelargest increase in BMI occurred in the group of soldiers aged 19 to 30. In the Air Force,educational programs on health promotion specific to the Air Force and individual militaryspecialties should be introduced.  Preventive programs to date have not contributed toan increase in care regarding the correct level of body weight, and to an increase in levelof awareness regarding the positive aspects of physical activity.  The above statements
were particularly strongly confirmed by the results of research on soldiers of the youngest
age (up to the age of 30).  It is therefore all the more necessary to undertake immediateeducational interventions.

Abstract:
Knowledge of the energy expenditure related to the training of policemen allows for
assessment of the intensity of the work performed and is an indispensable element of planning andimplementing nutrition. This study on energy expenditure comprised a total of 280 persons, studentsof two Polish police schools and two police training centers. The energy expenditure of policemen
was determined based on measurements of the heart rate using Polar RC3 GPS heart rate monitors.
The energy expenditure of policemen associated with the training process in the police schools and
training centers ranged from 1793 to 3043 kcal/8 h and amounted to 2314
±
945 kcal/8 h during
training on average.  The values of energy expenditure related to a typical training day in Polish
institutions conducting police training are diverse and depend on the specificity and nature of thetraining. According to the criteria for assessing the burden of work, the work performed by policeofficers can be classified as hard work and very hard work.Keywords:

1. Introduction
Many studies have concluded that physical inactivity is a primary cause of most
chronic diseases [
1
–
3
]. The benefits of physical activity for maintaining health have been
well documented, especially in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases such
as certain cancers, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases [
4
,
5
].  This is especially
important in the police force, as law enforcement officers are often required to adapt quicklyfrom sedentary, passive functions to hostile environments where maximum body effort isneeded [
6
]. In this context, accurate measurement of energy expenditure is essential for
both epidemiological studies and assessment of human nutritional needs [
7
,
8
].
Total energy expenditure is the energy required by the body during a 24-h period and
is determined by the sum of three components: basal energy expenditure, diet-inducedthermogenesis, and physical activity [
9
]. Determination of energy expenditure is important
to adjust the nutritional habits of individual people and must take into account the energyrequirements for physical activity and specific health conditions. To date, no research has

been conducted in Poland on the energy burden associated with the service and trainingof officers studying at police schools and trained at police training centers. In the Polishuniformed services, such research was conducted only among students of various types ofmilitary schools and fire schools. These studies indicate that students at military universities
were burdened with an energy expenditure of 3339 to 4121 kcal/d, while students at fire
schools—from 3735 to 4745 kcal/d [
10
–
13
].  According to the workload classification by
Lehman, they performed medium to very heavy work [
14
].
The issues related to energy expenditure, the energy value of food, and, consequently,
the systemic energy balance are of particular importance in the uniformed services. Knowl-edge of the physical burden connected with the specificity of the service performed shouldbe an indispensable element of food planning, which must cover the energy needs of thebody and provide all necessary nutrients in the right amounts and proportions. The policeare a uniformed and armed formation serving the public and intended to protect humansecurity and to maintain public safety and order. Knowledge of the energy expenditurerelated to the training of police officers allows for assessment of the severity of work
performed and provides a possibility to quantify it and forms the basis for establishing
nutrition standards. The heaviness of work, the measure of which is the value of energy ex-
penditure, is an indispensable element of an assessment of physical load in accordance with
psychophysical capabilities, while the physical load is a relation between the requirements
of work based on physical effort and the capabilities of the body.
The aim of this study was to determine the energy expenditure of students at police
schools and police training centers in relation to the specificity and nature of the training toassess degree of intensity of their work.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Participants
The research on energy expenditure covered 270 students at four police training
institutions: two police schools, a police training center, and a police prevention department.
The examination of energy expenditure covered 280 persons trained in 2 Polish police
schools and 2 police training centers.  The research involved 60 students at the policeacademy, including 50 men and 10 women; 113 students, all men, trained on specialistcourses at the police training center; 47 students at the police school; and 60 policementrained at the police prevention department.
Due to the small number of women studying in police schools and police training
centers, only men took part in the research. Thus, the study covered 50 students of the policeacademy, 113 students trained in specialist courses at the police training center, 47 studentsat the police school, and 60 students at the police prevention department.  Among the
113 students of the police training center, 74 people were trained on a specialist course for
police officers intervening against aggressive and dangerous persons, 18 participated in
training for future police dog handlers, and 21 were trained to work in the water police.
All students participated in the same theoretical classes and classes on the use of weapons,
while the other specialist classes took into account the specificity of the future service in
the police.
The research on the students of the police academy and the police school was con-
ducted during typical training activities included in the training plan and covered both
theoretical classes in the form of lectures and those related to high physical activity, such astactics or shooting.
The research was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of the World
Medical Association and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Military Instituteof Hygiene and Epidemiology (no. 1/XXI 95/2016). Participants received an informationsheet about the details of the study,  the purpose,  and the procedures used as well as
potential risks and benefits of their participation.

2.2. Measurement of Height and Weight
Body height (without shoes) was measured using a portable stadiometer (TANITA
HR-001, Tanita Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Body weight was measured using a bioelectri-cal impedance analysis (BIA) with the TANITA MC-780 103 device (Tanita Corporation,
Tokyo, Japan
),  with an accuracy of 0.1 kg,  according to the procedure specified in the
instruction manual (lightly dressed, without shoes). All measurements were performed ac-cording to the procedure specified in the instruction manual and without any metal objects.2.3. Measurement of Energy Expenditure
The method of analyzing heart rate changes was used to measure energy expenditure.
The energy expenditure study included heart rate measurements with a Polar RC3 GPS
heart rate monitor (Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland).  The values of energy expendi-ture of the activities performed by the policemen constitute the average value of at leastthree measurements. The obtained results were the basis for determining the energy de-
mand of policemen in relation to the specificity and nature of training and/or service, as
well as for the assessment of the intensity of work, in accordance with the classification
given by Lehman (Table
1
)[

].

2.4. Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using the program R (The R Foundation for
Statistical Computing v2.0–1.
https://cran.r-project.org
, accessed on 20 September 2021).
Anthropometric data are shown as mean values
±
standard deviation, and differences
among experimental groups were analyzed with Student’s
t
-test, which were statistically
significant when
p
<  0.05.   To  check  the  compliance  of  the  variables  with  the  normal
distribution, the Shapiro–Wilk test was used, and Levene’s test was used for verificationof the homogeneity of variance.  The differences in the values of energy expenditure ofstudents at individual universities and training centers were calculated using the chi-squaretest. The data spread is presented in interquartile range (IQR) values.3. Results3.1. Characteristics of the Studied Groups
The characteristics of the studied groups are given in Table
2
.
In the police academy, the research included students of the police service preparation course.
The group of people trained in the police prevention department was the youngest,
which resulted from the student selection criteria, while students at the police school were
characterized by the highest body weight.3.2. Energy Expenditure of Police Academy Students
The study of students’ energy expenditure was carried out during the implementation
of tasks in the study program at the police academy. It included measurements both during
typical theoretical classes and in field conditions, during which students learned how to

].
3.3. Energy Expenditure of Students at the Police Training Center3.3.1. Energy Expenditure of Students Trained on Specialist Courses for Police Officers
The research on energy expenditure covered 74 men, all students at the police training
center trained on specialist courses for police officers intervening against aggressive anddangerous people and for instructors of police shooting in anti-terrorist police units. Themean body weight and mean height of the officers were 90.4
±
13.8 kg and 179.7
±
7.8 cm,
respectively.  The energy expenditure of police officers trained for the above-mentionedspecialist courses included both training tasks of a theoretical nature (lectures) and thoserelated to high physical activity, e.g., preparation and implementation of shooting.  Theresults of the energy load of officers in relation to the training process are summarized in
Table
4
.
It was shown that the average energy expenditure of an officer associated with a
typical 8-h day of program training was 2458
±
723 kcal, which places the work performed
in the category of very heavy work. It should be emphasized that there is a large variationin the results of energy load related to the implementation of various types of training.
Theoretical training resulted in a low energy load of students, amounting to 1.75 kcal/min,
which was characteristic of light work, while during intensive tactical classes, it amounted
to 7.67 kcal/min, indicating the performance of hard work.

The police training center trains, among others, police officers who perform tasks on
waters and in surrounding areas. During these courses, students acquire skills related to
performing specialized tasks in the preventive service on water; rescuing and searching
for people, property, and floating equipment; and maneuvering a boat in difficult andextreme weather conditions.   They also acquire skills in organizing rescue operations,
handling specialized rescue and navigation equipment, and learning to use modern meansof transport, including water scooters, while on patrol. The training process takes placemainly on water and concerns driving and operating motorboats and navigation and rescueoperations in water areas.
The study of energy expenditure of police officers connected with the specificity of
this training covered 21 male officers, aged 34.5
±
6.6 years, with an average body weight

It was shown that an 8-h day of training resulted in an energy load of 1973
±
553 kcal,
indicating that they were performing heavy work. The relatively low energy expenditure ofthe water police trainees compared to those participating in other courses results from thespecificity of patrolling water areas on motorboats, which is related to their low physicalactivity. Analysis of the average values of energy expenditure incurred by officers duringthe 8-h training process in the three centers included in the police training center showedthat officers were burdened with different levels of energy expenditure, which resultedfrom the specificity of the training.  The highest value of energy load related to the 8-htraining day was found in officers trained on specialist courses and during the training ofservice dog handlers, which qualified the work as very hard work, while officers trainedon water performed heavy work.3.4. Energy Expenditure of Policemen Trained in the Police School
The police school specializes in training prevention police officers, i.e., those whose
service has a direct impact on public order and the sense of security of citizens. Among otherthings, the school provides basic vocational training that every police officer admitted to theservice must undergo. It prepares them for the implementation of tasks in basic executive
positions (e.g., in patrol and intervention services, in police prevention units, or in a convoy
service). Students gain knowledge and skills in the fields of law, crime prevention, forensics,
intervention tactics and techniques, psychology,  social communication,  ethics, humanrights, first aid, shooting training, and operation of IT and communication equipment.
They learn how to perform patrol intervention and convoy protection services as well as
the specifics of work as a district policeman and unit officer on duty.
A total of 47 male officers with an average body weight and height of 93.8
±
15.3 kg
and 180.4
±
6.9 cm, respectively, were included in this energy expenditure study.
The results of the research on the energy load of officers during the 8-h training day
are summarized in Table
7
.
The results of the research on the energy expenditure of officers trained in the police
school show that the work performed during the training is very hard work.3.5. Energy Expenditure of Policemen Trained in the Police Prevention Unit
Police prevention units are designed mainly for team activities within compact sub-
units. The main tasks of these units include the following:
-
Protection of public security and order during legal gatherings and mass events;
-
Restoring public order in the event of collective violation of the law;
18

IJERPH

,
19
, 6828
-
Protection of public order in the event of constitutionally defined states of emergencyas well as catastrophes and natural disasters;
-
Pursuit of dangerous criminals.
The study involved 60 officers with an average body weight of 83.7
±
12.5 kg and an
average body height of 180.3
±

The analysis of the obtained values of energy load of the examined students in relation
to the training processes showed that their energy expenditure from the implementationof individual training tasks was similar and ranged from 0.42 to 0.71 kcal/min/kg bw
(Table
10
).   Although the largest energy expenditure related to the implementation of
individual training activities, as well as that related to the 8-h training process, was observedin the students of police prevention units, it was not a statistically significant difference.On the other hand, the lowest energy expenditure related to the training was observed inthe water police.

4. Discussion
Poland is one of the few countries where determination of the energy expenditure of
workers on tasks at work is required by law. Information on how physically demandingwork is (a measure of energy expenditure) at each workstation is essential not only for
comparison with applicable regulations concerning maximum allowable values for regular
work activity but also for work planning and taking proactive action to reduce the adverse
health effects of work.
The value of energy expenditure related to an 8-h work shift should be taken into
account when planning work, planning breaks, and allocating preventive meals and drinksby the employer. Heavy workload increases the risk of musculoskeletal system dysfunc-tion, which is one of the causes of accelerated degenerative changes (especially of thespine) and an accelerated decline in exercise capacity.  Hard physical work should alsobe considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disorders such as high blood pressure andischemic heart disease.  The assessment of energy expenditure, and thus the severity of
work performed, allows to quantify the physical load of an employee according to his/her
endurance capabilities.
Law  enforcement  is  a  highly  stressful  occupation  that  is  prone  to  increasing  the
prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular disease. Evidence indicates that the prevalence
of traditional cardiovascular risk factors among police officers is high (often higher than inthe general population). Police work creates exposure to risk factors for the developmentof cardiovascular disease and diabetes and results in increased mortality rates [
15
–
17
].
Epidemiological studies suggest that police officers and related public security personneldevelop an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Currently employed
police personnel have a high prevalence of traditional risk factors, including hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, smoking, and a sedentary lifestyle. Moreover, low
physical activity of policemen leads to a positive energy balance and, consequently, to
20

IJERPH
2022
,
19
, 6828
obesity [
18
,
19
].   Obesity may be more common among police officers compared with
civilians, whereas diabetes is present less frequently. Law enforcement personnel are alsoexposed to occupational risk factors such as sudden physical exertion, acute and chronic
psychological stress, shift work, and noise [
16
].  Obesity not only affects the ability of
police officers to perform their work-related duties, but consequently, it may also impactpublic safety.
In the available literature, there are few works concerning the energy expenditure
of students at police schools and police officers trained in police training centers.  The
values of energy expenditure obtained in the present study indicate that the energy loads of
students and trainees participating in training programs in Polish police schools and policetraining centers range from 1973
±
553 to 3043
±
1308 kcal/8 h of work. These values place
their work in the category of very hard work.
Studies in police schools can be compared to studies from fire service schools.  The
results of earlier research revealed that the values of energy expenditure during typicalactivities from the training program prepared for students at the Main School of Fire
Service were diverse and ranged from 1.49 to 10.66 kcal/min. According to Christensen’sclassification of work severity, the work performed by students can be classified as light
work to very heavy work [
20
]. The average daily energy load of students at the Main School
of Fire Service on a typical day of training on the training ground was 4745
±
1181 kcal/d,
which means that the work performed should be considered, according to the obligatory
classification of work intensity, as very heavy [
11
].
Previous studies on the energy load of students at the National Fire Service Aspirants
School showed that their daily energy expenditure from the training process amounted to3735.5 kcal, while durin
g8hofpr
ogram classes, students expended only 1289.5 kcal [
12
].
Historical studies on the energy burden of 30 male and 10 female police cadets, ran-
domly selected from the Singapore Police Force, showed that the value of daily energy ex-
penditure associated with duty and training tasks was 3028 and 1752 kcal, respectively [
21
].
A study on the energy expenditure of 28 healthy police officers working in shifts
showed that the energy expenditure was 3062 kcal/d during night shifts, amounted to
2647 kcal/d during day shifts, and was the lowest on holiday duty, when it amounted to2310 kcal/d [
22
].
An assessment of the service-related daily energy expenditure of Malaysian police officers
showed that males expended 2639.6
±
229.4 kcal/d and females 2268.9
±
203.5 kcal/d [
23
].
The values obtained in the present study on energy expenditure associated with
studies and training in Polish police schools and police training centers confirm the resultsof previous research, indicating that both studies and police training as well as policeservice are characterized by work that falls into the category of heavy work.5. Conclusions

Assuming that the average value of men’s energy expenditure during the training
process  in  Polish  police  schools  and  the  police  training  center,  as  well  as  in  the
prevention unit, amounts to 2314
±
945 kcal/8 h of training, it should be concluded
that the work performed by police officers belongs to the category of very hard work.
2.
The energy expenditure related to the implementation of the study and training
program depends on the type of university or training center as well as the specificity
of the performed training activities.
3.
The energy value of the daily food ration used in the nutrition of police officers trained in Pol-
ish police schools and police training centers should be adjusted to their energy expenditure.

Abstract:
The main factors that determine the effectiveness and reliability of duties and tasks per-
formed by border guard officers, are very good health and maintaining a high level of psychophysicalfitness that depend mainly on adequate diet and physical activity and thus, nutritional status. Theaim of the study was to verify the correlations between dietary habits, physical activity level andselected nutritional status indicators. One hundred and sixty-nine male border guard officers partici-
pated in the study. A 61-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to assess dietary habits
and a long-form International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used to assess physicalactivity. Fat mass was determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and bone calcification
was assessed by the dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Many correlations between dietary
habits, as well as the physical activity of officers and body mass index (BMI), fat mass index (FMI) and
visceral fat level (VFL) were found, while bone mineral density (BMD T-score) negatively correlated
only with two food groups and 6 out of 61 products but did not correlate with physical activity. Theresults also confirmed many poor dietary habits and abnormalities in nutritional status. Thus, thereis a need for nutritional education and further monitoring of health-related behaviors, as well asmonitoring the nutritional status of border guard officers.Keywords:

Very good health and maintaining high level of psychophysical fitness are the main fac-
tors that determine the effectiveness and reliability of duties and tasks performed by BorderGuard officers. The main tasks include border protection and the control of border traffic [
1
].
Some of the border guard’s duties are performed in diverse geographical conditions, suchas the sea area or mountains, thus maintaining a healthy condition and psychophysicalfitness are crucial. Changing circumstances, i.e., during the deployment period, may leadto modification of dietary habits and exercise routine, for example with a negative effecton body composition and physical performance [
2
]. Thus, it is very important to maintain
good nutritional status which mainly depends on diet and physical activity.
Optimizing nutrition strategies to support health and performance is important, espe-
cially for physically active people [
3
] as well as tactical personnel [
4
]. The recommendations,
for example position stands developed by the International Society of Sports Nutrition,

such as nutrient timing [
5
], protein and exercise [
6
] can be also applied as some of the nutri-
tion recommendations for uniformed forces. Nevertheless, the basic principles of healthydiet and implementing a balance and diverse diet with high nutritional density are crucial,especially considering the poor dietary habits observed in these populations [
4
,
7
–
10
]. Diet
quality, eating styles, and macronutrient composition influence body composition [
11
].
Too low an energy intake can lead to weight loss, especially a decrease in muscle mass,
or decrease in bone density, which may negatively affect psychophysical performance,
prolong recovery time and increase injury risk [
2
,
12
]. On the other hand, too high an energy
intake may cause weight gain, and thus indirectly increase the risk of obesity that mightresult in difficulties in fulfilling service tasks. These abnormalities might be also the reasonfor early service eliminations because of health concerns.
The second factor that significantly affects body composition is physical activity. It
not only leads to increasing physical performance and muscle mass, but also, as the most
variable component of daily energy expenditure, determines energy balance [
13
]. Lifelong
exercise delays the onset of 40 chronic diseases, such as coronary (ischemic) heart diseases,hypertension, obesity, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, depression,and anxiety [
14
].  The evidence for the notion of “exercise is medicine” is strong, and
physical activity has been used in both the prevention and treatment strategies for various
diseases [
15
].   It is also an interaction between physical activity and other factors,  for
example diet and genetics that increases disease risk factors.
Since physical inactivity is considered as the biggest public health problem of the 21st
century [
16
], the growing trend of people with overweight and obesity is also observed
in the general population [
17
,
18
], as well as among uniformed service officers [
19
–
25
].
According to the last study, the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the Polish Army
Forces (50% and 17% of men) [
10
] is similar to that in the general population of Poland (52%
and 16% of men) [
18
]. Border guard officers, like other uniformed services, attend physical
education classes and are obligated to complete annual physical fitness
test [
26
,
27
]
. Never-
theless, it has been observed that not all of border guard officers attend sport classes [
28
–
30
].
It has been shown that both occupational and leisure time physical activity are associated
with body composition in police officers [
31
], thus it is necessary to assess the level of
physical activity including both physical activity during work and physical activity as sport
and leisure time.
Proper diet, regular physical activity, and thus nutritional status are extremely impor-
tant for uniformed forces, affecting their physical fitness and their suitability for service.However, the literature on these associations between lifestyle factors and body composi-tion among tactical personnel is relatively scarce, especially there has been a lack of researchcarried out among border guard officers. Therefore, the aim of the study was to verify thecorrelations between dietary habits, physical activity level and selected nutritional statusindicators:  body mass index (BMI), fat mass index (FMI), visceral fat level (VFL), bonemineral density (BMD T-score) and muscle mass index (MMI) in border guard officersfrom Poland.2. Materials and Methods
The study was carried out with the participation of 169 male border guard officers
from Poland. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study. Thestudy was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by theEthics Committee of the Military Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (1/XXI/2016).2.1. Eating Meals, Food Consumption Frequency Assessment and Dietary Patterns
A two-part questionnaire was used to assess diet. The first part contained questions
about the regularity of eating five meals with three possible answers to choose:  everyday, not every day, never.  The second part was the evaluated 61-item food frequency
questionnaire (FFQ) [
32
], slightly modified by adding two new categories of answers in
this questionnaire, as in an earlier study [
9
].
26

IJERPH

19
, 5305
Border guard officers were asked, included in the FFQ, how often they had consumed
61 food products in the past 12 months.  For each product they could choose one of theeight answers regarding food consumption frequency: 1—never or almost never, 2—oncea quarter or less often, 3—once a month or less often, 4—a few times a month, 5—once a
week, 6—several times a week, 7—every day, 8—several times a day.
Reported frequencies were calculated into daily frequencies (time/day), as follows: never
or almost never—0.003 (1/365), once a quarter or less often—0.01 (4/365), once a month orless often—0.03 (1/30), a few times a month—0.08 (2.5/30), once a
week—0.14 (1/7)
, several
times a week—0.57 (4/7), every day—1, several times a day—2. Converted frequencies
were also summed within the main food groups, that were identified as:
1.
Fruits, vegetables, and potatoes.
2.
Seeds of legumes.
3.
Cereal products.
4.
Dairy products and eggs.
5.
Meat products and fish.
6.
Fats, nuts, and grains
7.
Sweets and snacks.
8.
Soft drinks.
9.
Alcoholic beverages.
Converted frequencies of the main food groups were used to obtain dietary patterns.
2.2. Physical Activity Assessment
A long-form International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used to assess
physical activity level [
33
].  Officers were asked to answer 27 questions about physical
activity during work/job, transportation, homework, house maintenance, and caring forfamily,  recreation,  sport,  and leisure-time,  as well as time spent sitting.   Then results
were calculated as metabolic equivalent (MET-minutes/week) according to the scoring
protocol [
34
].
2.3. Nutritional Status Assessment
The TANITA HR-001 stadiometer (Tanita Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was used to
measure height. The head was aligned in the Frankfort horizontal plane [
35
]. Body weight
and body composition (fat mass, visceral fat level, muscle mass) were evaluated usingthe TANITA MC-780 analyzer (Tanita Corporation,  Tokyo,  Japan).   All measurements
were performed in accordance with the procedures from the instruction manuals. Three
additional indicators were calculated: body mass index (BMI), fat mass index (FMI) andmuscle mass index (MMI):
BMI = body weight/height
2
[kg/m
2
],
FMI = fat mass/height
2
[kg/m
2
],
MMI = muscle mass/ height
2
[kg/m
2
].
The scale of BMI classification reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) [
36
]
and the scale of FMI described by Kelly et al. [
37
] were accepted.
Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured in the forearm bone of the nondominant
hand, using Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) densitometric method, with anEXA 3000 analyzer (OsteoSys, Seoul, Korea). The results were interpreted in accordance
with the WHO standards for BMD T-score: osteoporosis: BMD T-score
≤−
2.5, osteopenia:
−
2.5 < BMD T-score
≤−
1.0, standard: BMD T-score >
−
1.0 [
38
].
2.4. Statistical Analysis
The PS IMAGO PRO (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY, USA) program was used for
all statistical analyses. Shapiro–Wilk test was used to verify the compatibility of variabledistribution with normal distribution. Due to noncompliance of analyzed variables withnormal distribution,  Spearman’s correlation was conducted to assess the associationsamong dietary habits, physical activity and five nutritional status indicators (BMI, FMI,
27

, 5305
VFL, BMD T-score, and MMI). Two dietary patterns were identified using the K-means
cluster analysis. Input variables were converted to standardized scores. Logistic regression
was used to assess the relationship between excess fat mass and potential risk factors. For
all analysis the significant level of
α
= 0.05 was assumed.
3. Results
The study was conducted among 169 male border guard officers aged 37
±
6 years.
The average length of service was 13
±
7 years. About 1/3 of the subjects lived in a city
of over 100 thousand inhabitants (32%), 35% in a city of up to 100 thousand inhabitants,
and the rest lived in the country (33%). Almost 3/4 of officers were higher educated (71%),
while others were secondary educated (29%). Nearly 2/3 of subjects assessed the physical
level of work as light (27%) or performed while sitting (38%). According to 30% of officers,their work was moderate, and for others it was hard (5%).3.1. Eating Meals, Food Consumption Frequency and Dietary Patterns
The meals that were most often eaten every day were dinner (84%), breakfast (83%)
and supper (66%) (Table
1
). Lunch was eaten every day only by 30%, afternoon snack by
18%, and supper by 66% of officers.

Fruits (all types) were eaten every day by only 30% of subjects, out of which barely
3% ate them several times a day (Table S1). About half of officers (51%) ate fruits severaltimes a week.  The most common fruits consumed were apples and pears (eaten morethan once a week by 61% of subjects), and bananas (eaten more than once a week by 43%of subjects), while avocado, olives and other tropical fruits (not including kiwi fruit andcitrus) were the least often consumed. Vegetables (all types) were eaten every day by only32% of officers, including 3% of them who ate these products several times a day. Almosthalf of subjects (49%) ate vegetables several times a week. Tomatoes were the most oftenconsumed vegetable (eaten more than once a week by 73% of officers), while leafy green
vegetables and crucifers were the least often consumed (eaten more than once a week by
31% and 33 % of officers). So-called dark bread (wholemeal or with grains) was eaten everyday by only 26%, while so-called white bread by 33%. Most of the officers consumed alldairy products, as well as eggs, less than daily.  Meat products, especially high-qualitycold-cuts and sausages were much more popular than fish—both lean and oily fish wereeaten less than once a week by most of the officers (69% and 75%). Although nuts weremore popular than grains, only 21% and 10% of subjects ate these products more than oncea week.  Sweets were more popular than salty snacks.  More than half of officers (53%)never or almost never consumed energy drinks, while sweetened sodas such as beer wereconsumed more than once a week by 23% and 28% of subjects. Two major dietary patterns
were identified using the K-means cluster analysis. The first one Dietary pattern 1—was
a more healthy and more varied diet, while Dietary pattern 2 was a less healthy and less
varied diet. Barely 24% of border guard officers were classified in the more healthy diet
group (Dietary pattern 1). The differences between these two dietary patterns are describedin Table

3.2. Physical Activity
Based on the IPAQ, the average total physical activity equaled 17,255
±
14,152 (median:
13,692) MET-minutes per week (Table
3
). The largest part of physical activity was job-related
physical activity (39%). Housework, house maintenance, caring for family accounted for
22%, transportation for 20%, and recreation, sport and leisure-time physical activity for 19%of the total value of physical activity. Taking into consideration the intensity level, walkingcounted for 38%, moderate physical activity for 36%, and intensive physical activity for26% of the total value of physical activity. According to the IPAQ classification, 93% officers
were characterized by a high and 7% by a moderate level of physical activity. The mean
time spent in the sitting position on weekdays was 4.8
±
2.8 (median: 4.0) hours a day, and
on weekends it was 3.9
±
2.3 (median: 4.0) hours a day, however the result values ranged
from 0.5 up to 14.5 h a day.

3.3. Nutritional Status
Nutritional status indicators varied among the examined border guard officers (
Table
4
).
Body weight ranged from 62.5 to 114.9 kg and height ranged from 165.6 to 199.3 cm. Ac-cording to the BMI classification, normal weight was observed in only 32% of officers, while67% officers were overweight (53%) or obese (14%).  However, normal fat was found in54% of officers, and excess fat in 39%.  Additionally, in the group with BMI higher than25 kg/m
2
, 58% of the officers were normal fat, and only 42% were classified as excess
fat.  Almost all of participants (96%) had a healthy level of visceral fat, according to the
Tanita classification. Sufficient bone mineral density was observed in 87% of the subjects,
osteopenia—12%, and osteoporosis—1%.

Since there were no associations between age and BMI, FMI, BMD (t-score) and MMI,
age was positively correlated with VFL (Table

correlated with each other.

Twelve negative correlations between the main food groups consumption frequency
and BMI (fruits, vegetables, and potatoes; seeds of legumes; dairy products and eggs; fats,nuts, and grains), FMI (fruits, vegetables, and potatoes; seeds of legumes; dairy productsand eggs) VFL (fruits, vegetables, and potatoes; seeds of legumes; dairy products andeggs) and BMDT-score (fruits, vegetables, and potatoes; dairy products and eggs) werefound (Table S2).  Out of the selected 61 products negative correlations were observedbetween BMI and 18 products (fruits together—all type; other tropical fruits; bananas;sweet fruit preserves and candied fruits; vegetables—all types; yellow–orange vegetables;leafy green vegetables; fresh seeds of legumes and canned ones; potatoes in various forms;unrefined groats coarse; refined cereal grain; ready-to-eat breakfast cereal products; milkand milk drinks; butter; nuts; grains; honey; vegetable juices and vegetable-fruit ones).FMI negatively correlated with almost all of products from the first group, including fruits,
vegetables, and potatoes (14 of 18), and with seeds of legumes, unrefined groats coarse;
refined cereal grain; ready-to-eat breakfast cereal products; milk and milk drinks; lean fish;nuts; grains; honey; vegetable juices and vegetable-fruit ones.  Positive correlation wasobserved only between FMI and sweetened sodas such as Fanta, Coca-Cola, Mirinda, Sprite.
VFL negatively correlated with 20 out of 61 analyzed foods. The BMD T-score negatively
correlated with six products (yellow–orange vegetables; tomatoes; potatoes; cottage cheese;eggs; honey).
It was found that officers with more healthy dietary habits (dietary pattern 1) had
significantly lower BMI (
p
= 0.001), FMI (
p
< 0.001) and VFL (
p
< 0.001) than officers from
the less healthy diet group (Table
6
).
No associations between the total amount of physical activity and BMI, FMI, VFL,
and BMD T-score were observed (Table
7
).  However, correlations were found between
several categories of physical activity and BMI, FMI and VFL. Recreation, sport and leisure-time physical activity negatively correlated with BMI (Rho =
−
0.182;
p
= 0.018),  FMI
(Rho =
−
0.277;
p
< 0.001) and VFL (Rho=
−
0.228;
p
= 0.003), while waking negatively
correlated only with BMI (Rho =
−
0.156;
p
= 0,043).  Time spent sitting at the weekend
positively correlated with FMI (Rho = 0.198;
p
= 0.014) and VFL (Rho = 0.172;
p
= 0.034).
Only one correlation was found between muscle mass expressed as MMI and walking
(Rho=
−
0.186;
p
= 0.015).

Our results confirm that there are some relationships between diet, physical activity
and nutritional status indicators assessing body mass, fat mass, visceral fat mass and bonemineral density among border guard officers.  Many irregularities in dietary habits (i.e.,insufficient meals inadequate consumption of some food groups) as well as in nutritionalstatus were also observed.
Poor eating habits resulted in abnormalities in officers’ nutritional status. The strongest
correlations (negative) were found between BMI, FMI and VFL, and nuts, fruit and veg-etables, and dairy products frequency consumption. The frequency of the consumptionof these products was not compatible with the current recommendations. Barely 1/3 ofofficers ate fruits and vegetables daily, but only 3% ate these products a few times a day.Our finding are worrying and in line with the general tendency of decreasing fruit and
vegetable consumption in past years, that has been observed in household budget surveys
by Statistics Poland [
39
]. Between 2000 and 2018, the average monthly consumption per
capita of fruit decreased from 4.1 kg to 3.7 kg, and the average monthly consumption percapita of vegetables decreased from 13.3 to 7.9 kg. Similar dietary mistakes, i.e., consumingless than the recommended 4–5 meals a day, insufficient consumption of fruit, vegetables,nuts, diary, were also observed in the general population in Poland [
40
], as well as among
soldiers [
7
,
9
] and other physically active groups, i.e., athletes [
41
]. Poor dietary habits may
result in a worse body composition and can lead to obesity [
11
]. In a recent study, Ga  ́
zdz-
i ́
nska et al. observed that consumption of sweetened beverages was higher in soldiers with
BMI
≥
30 as compared to normal weight soldiers, while there were no differences in the
number of meals during the day, snacking between meals, or fast-food consumption [
10
].
However, most of the surveyed declared eating sweets (80%) and fast-food (69%), and only33% of soldiers were classified with normal weight. The authors showed that the risk ofobesity increases with the age of 40, but is not limited to this, due to over consumption offood in stressful situations and lower physical activity.
The level of physical activity in almost all of the border guard officers was high (93%),
similar to the earlier research among soldiers [
9
]. No correlations between total physical
activity and BMI, FMI VFL, BMD-T-score, and MMI were observed. MMI was associatedonly with walking (negative correlation) while only physical activity during recreation,sport, and leisure-time negatively correlated with BMI and FMI. Similar relationshipsbetween LTPA and body composition were also observed in police officers [
31
,
42
]. Police
officers with higher physical activity level had lower fat mass. It was also reported that
police officers who were physically active and had a low level of body fat had better reaction
times [
43
]. In another study it was observed that high level of body fat was associated with
low level of physical performance [
44
]. In our study, time spent sitting positively correlated
with FMI, and this was also observed by other authors [
45
,
46
].
During physical education classes border guard officers attend classes such as swim-
ming and water rescue, water sports, martial arts, and training of the use of firearms. In
previous studies it was shown that in a group of 55 female border guard officers almost
2/3 practiced sports (5% competitive, and 69% recreational), but 26% did not perform anyleisure-time physical activity [
28
]. In another study, in another group of 53 male and female
border guard officers only 36% were physically active in their spare time [
30
]. However, in
a different study with a larger surveyed group (121 female and 338 male) the percentageof not performing any leisure-time physical activity was lower—7% of female and 4% of
34

IJERPH
2022
,
19
, 5305
male [
29
]. According to the IPAQ classification the level of physical activity in border guard
officers from their own research was higher than in the last study performed by Ły
 ̇
zwi  ́
nski
(93% with the high and 7% with the moderate level of physical activity vs. 58% with the
high, 36% with the moderate, and 6% with the low level of physical activity) [
47
]
According to the BMI, excessive body mass was found in 67%, while based on FMI,
excessive amount of fat mass was found in 39% of border guard officers.  Our results are
consistent with a recent study describing the ratio of overweight or obesity in 69% men fromPoland aged 18–64 [
18
]. Border guard officers were more likely to have excess fat mass than
soldiers from Poland [
9
] (39% vs. 19%), while the average BMI value was more similar (26.6 vs.
25.6 kg/m
2
).  High prevalence of uniformed force officers with overweight or obesity was
also observed in other studies, i.e., among police officers [
21
,
48
], soldiers [
9
,
19
,
20
,
22
–
25
], and
firefighters [
49
].  However, it must be highlighted that using only the BMI classification to
verify overweight or obesity, especially in physically active groups may be incorrect due to
usual extensive muscle mass [
50
]. The authors found that major discrepancy exists between
obesity according to BMI (about 25%) and being diagnosed for obesity with the ICD code
(12.5% of diagnosed for obesity by BMI). In our study similar differences were also observed.
The average BMI was higher than the reference value for normal weight, while the average
FMI was adequate.  Out of 67% of the officers classified with BMI higher than 25 kg/m
2
,
excessive fat mass (based on FMI) was found only in less than half of them (42%). It is stronglyrecommended to be particularly careful when interpreting BMI values in adults with increased
physical activity [
51
]. Moreover, some authors recommend that the optimal cut off point for
interpreting obesity in active duty service members is BMI of 29 kg/m
2
in men and BMI
of 26 kg/m
2
in women [
52
].  It means that BMI 25–29 kg/m
2
may be not useful for clearly
discriminating between lean and fat mass in physically actives, especially active-duty servicemembers [
22
,
50
]. In one of the recent studies, there was an attempt to assess adiposity in the
U.S. The military based a combination of BMI + circumference-based equations, however itresulted in poor sensitivity [
25
].
The main limitation of our study is the relatively small group (169 officers).   We
conducted our research only among men, so future studies should include both men and
women.   The other limitation is using FFQ to assess diet.   Although it is not an ideal
method, it has been widely used in various studies.  Some of the obtained Spearman’s
correlations might be difficult to interpret based on only FFQ without portions of consumedfoods. Thus, in future studies comparing nutritional status with energy intake would be anadditional benefit. The other limitation is using only IPAQ to assess the physical activitylevel. For future studies, it is recommended to use an accelerometer and add more detailed
questions on the type of training (i.e., strength or endurance training). Energy as well as
macronutrient intake (protein, fat and carbohydrate) and a detailed description of physicalactivity could be used for more detailed analyses, i.e., to assess associations between musclemass and dietary intakes and physical activity among uniformed service officers.5. Conclusions
Our study confirmed correlations between diet,  physical activity and body mass
index, fat mass index, visceral fat level, and bone mineral density in male border guardofficers. Higher body mass and fat mass were correlated with poorer dietary habits, i.e.,
low consumption of fruit, vegetables, dairy, nuts, grains, as well as with lower leisure-time
physical activity and longer time spent sitting during the day.
There is a strong need for further monitoring of health-related behaviors among border
guard officers due to the many dietary mistakes and abnormalities in nutritional status that
were observed. It is also necessary to provide nutritional education and encourage officers
to follow dietary recommendations.Supplementary Materials:

Abstract:
The 21st century is considered the age of malnutrition resulting in the unprecedented
frequency of civilization diseases.  Among these disorders, obesity is particularly distinguishedand  considered  an  epidemic-scale  disease.   For  this  reason,  conducting  studies  on  obesity  andcounteracting this phenomenon is essential.  Research from recent years indicates a problem of
excessive body weight among officers of uniformed services, who should be characterized by goodhealth and fitness level due to the specificity of the work. As the problem of obesity affects everyfourth Pole, research in uniformed services seems to be essential from health and national secu-rity perspectives.  The presented study aimed to determine the elements of nutritional status in289 students
of Polish police schools and police training centers. Body composition was determined
by bioelectrical impedance analysis, and bone calcification assessment was conducted by the DXAdensitometric method. Based on BMI and body fat content, body weight disorders were found in31.8% of all examined students. Densitometric test results showed changes in bone calcification of
varying severity in 26.6% of the total number of respondents. The presence of obesity in students
of police schools and training centers proves that the present nutrition model is energetically un-
balanced, while the demonstrated disorders of bone calcification indicate an improper condition ofmineral nutrition.Keywords:

1. Introduction
A multitude and variability of factors influencing food consumption necessitate their
monitoring as significant for human nutritional status. Nutritional status is a component ofa health condition resulting from the habitual consumption of food, the absorption anduse of its nutrients, and possible pathological factors that affect these processes [
1
]. The
purpose of nutritional status assessment is to identify people who exhibit malnourished
nutritional disorders or are overweight and obese. Overweight and obesity are commonhealth problems in 21st century societies.  The prevalence of overweight and obesity indeveloped countries, including Poland, has steadily increased and has been one of the

most common lifestyle-related health problems [
2
,
3
]. Globally, it is estimated that 44% of
adults and 20% of children over five are overweight or obese. Moreover, since 1975, thenumber of overweight and obese people has tripled and now accounts for 4 million deaths
worldwide each year, of which nearly 2/3 are due to cardiovascular disease [
4
]. Currently,
obesity is perceived as aesthetically problematic and, primarily, as a severe medical issueand pathophysiological disorder caused by a superabundant accumulation of adiposetissue [
5
].  Excessive fat accumulation leads to negative consequences for the quality of
life and wellbeing, life expectancy and treatment costs [
6
,
7
], and an increased incidence of
chronic non-communicable diseases [
8
].
One of the methods of body weight monitoring is the use of body mass index—BMI—
which is the quotient of body weight (measured in kilograms) and the square of the height
(in meters).  It is widely used in public health and clinical nutrition to quickly evaluate
nutritional wellbeing, as excessive BMI is associated with increased risks of mortality,cardiovascular disease, and some cancers.  According to the standards adopted by the
World Health Organization (WHO), overweight is diagnosed when the BMI value is 25 or
more, and obesity is diagnosed when the value of this index is 30 or more [
9
]. Although
BMI has a significant limitation in the discrimination between adipose tissue and musclemass, it is included in several widely used nutritional screening tools [
10
].
The complexity of external and innate factors influencing nutritional status is evident.
The direct cause of overweight and obesity associated with the accumulation of adipose
tissue is an imbalance in energy management, caused by an excessive intake of calories
from food and drinks. It is favored by other factors, i.e., an inactive lifestyle, the popularityof  food  products  with  high  sugar  content,  new  technologies  reducing  physical  effort,environmental  and  genetic  factors,  and  family  habits.   However,  it  can  be  concludedthat nutritional status results from the applied nutrition model and physical load.  Thenutritional status assessment indicates whether the physiological needs of the subject inrelation to the nutrient requirements are met. Numerous observations of the relationshipbetween anthropometric measurements and nutrition have shown that such values asheight and weight or body fat content are reliable indicators of nutritional status. In turn,the proper nutritional status indicates that the demand for other nutrients is sufficientlycovered. Moreover, the assessment of the nutritional status allows the determination of thecurrent state of health and is a factor in forecasting the possible development of severalmetabolic diseases that are directly or indirectly related to nutrition.
Research conducted in the last decade shows that obesity and the ignorance of soldiers
and police officers about a healthy lifestyle are severe problems for uniformed services.It should be emphasized that these are professional groups on which the state’s securitydepends.   Our  previous  study  conducted  on  479  police  officers  showed  the  presenceof excessive body weight resulting from abdominal obesity in over 50% of male policeofficers [
11
]. A similar study conducted on 7000 Polish soldiers showed that cardiovascular
diseases among military personnel pose a more significant threat in this group than amongcivilians. The prevalence of obesity and related diseases—hypertension, high cholesterolor prediabetes, and smoking—was alarming [
12
]. The authors emphasized the irrational
nutrition model and the urgent need for nutritional education and prevention of civilization-related metabolic diseases among uniformed services. As a consequence of these studies,the National Health Program was conducted in 2016–2020, which included implementingoverweight and obesity reduction programs and a comprehensive study of the diet ofuniformed services employees.
In light of the above studies, assessing the components of nutritional status seems
to be essential both from a health and national security perspective.  The aim of the re-search study was to assess the frequency of abnormalities in the body composition andbone mineralization among officers of uniformed services.  Based on previous research,
we assumed that we would identify the irregularities mentioned earlier in a significant
group of respondents, and as a consequence, individual conversations and training onthe  importance  of  leading  a  healthy  lifestyle  would  be  conducted.   In  this  paper,  we

present the results of the studies realized as a part of the National Health Program con-
cerning candidates and police officers studying and serving in police schools and police
training centers.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Participants
The  study  on  elements  of  nutritional  status  covered  289  candidates,  including
48 female officers and 241 police officers.  The study was designed to reflect the char-
acteristics of the entire Police formation as well as the given training unit. Hence, the policeofficers trained in the Police Academy in Szczytno, Police Training Center in Legionowo,and its subordinate units (the Department of Police Cynology in Sułkowice, Water Police
Training Base in Kal, and Police Prevention Department in Rzesz
ó
w) were chosen as par-
ticipants of this study. The study on bone calcification covered 276 police officers trainedin Police Training Center in Legionowo, Police Academy in Szczytno, and Police Schoolin Słupsk. The field research was carried out from March to October 2019. The acceptedcriteria for inclusion in the study included age 18 to 60, active service in Police, and consentto the study. Women declaring pregnancy were excluded from the study.
The following parameters constituting the elements of nutritional status assessment
were measured: anthropometric measurements, BMI, and the total fat content in the body.
Moreover, bone density was assessed using the DEXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry)densitometric method. In the first step, the body weight and height of each of the surveyedofficers were measured and then, based on the results, the Body Mass Index (BMI) wasdetermined. The BMI value allowed the subjects to be classified into one of the four groups
(according to the WHO classification): underweight (BMI up to 18.4 kg/m
2
), average body
weight (BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m
2
), overweight (BMI 25.0–29.9 kg/m
2
), and obesity (BMI over
30.0 kg/m
2
)[
13
,
14
]. Moreover, based on the body fat content measured by multi-frequency
bioelectrical impedance, the Fat Mass Index was calculated with the following equation:FMI = fat
−
free mass/height
2
(kg/m
2
).  The scale of FMI classification developed by
Kelly et al.
was accepted, adopting FMI values between 3 and 6 as a normal fat mass,
FMI < 3
as fat deficit, and
FMI > 6
as excess fat [
15
]. Bone calcification was assessed based
on the value of the T-score, in which the mean value and standard deviation in the groupsof young adults were adopted as the reference range regardless of the patient’s age. The
T-score
value
−
1 was accepted as the normal standard, meaning that it is not smaller than
one standard deviation below the mean value. T-score values between
−
1 and
−
2.5 are
typical for osteopenia, and values less than
−
2.5 are typical for osteoporosis [
16
].  The
research was conducted in accordance with the 93rd Helsinki Declaration of the World
Medical Society and was positively verified by the Ethics Committee of the Military Instituteof Hygiene and Epidemiology (No. 1/XXI 95/2016). Participants received an informationsheet on the details and the purpose of the study, the procedures used, and the potentialrisks and benefits of their participation.2.2. Anthropometric Measurements
All measurements were made in accordance with the principles of good practice and
procedures specified in the instruction manual by qualified researchers. Height was mea-
sured using a portable stadiometer (without shoes) (TANITA HR-001, Tanita Corporation,
Tokyo, Japan).  The police officers were asked to stand barefoot on the footprints, with
his/her heels together and touching the backstop, keeping their legs straight, shoulders
relaxed, and head in the horizontal Frankfurt plane position.
Bodyweight and fat content were measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis
(BIA) using the TANITA MC-780 103 machine (Tanita Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with an
accuracy of 0.1 kg according to the procedure specified in the instruction manual (lightlydressed, without shoes) and with the use of a standard mode.  The measurements were
performed at room temperature, in light clothing, and under constant hydration conditions.
Subjects were recommended to refrain from eating and intense physical exertion for about

three hours before the study. The subjects were asked to discard any transmitting devicessuch as mobile phones or smartwatches that may affect the readings.
Bone mineral density was measured on the forearm of the non-dominant hand using
the DEXA method with the EXA 3000 densitometer (OsteoSys Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea).2.3. Statistical Analysis
The obtained results are presented as arithmetic means and standard deviation (SD).
There were no missing data in the presented study, as the complete set of the presented
data was collected from all subjects.
Statistical analyses were performed using Statistica 12.5 software (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK,
USA). The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to check the normality of the variables’distribution.   To  compare  the  results  between  the  two  groups,  the  Student’s
t
-test  or,
in the case of variables with a non-normal distribution, the Mann–Whitney U test was
used. For variables with non-normal distribution, non-parametric tests were performed:Kruskal–Wallis
test, which is a non-parametric equivalent of one-way analysis of variance,
and Dunn’s test, as an equivalent of post hoc tests. The value
α
= 0.05 was adopted as the
level of significance.3. Results
The nutritional status assessment covered 241 officers, including 75 trained at the
Police Academy, 69 at the Police Training Center, 39 at the Department of Police Cynology,and 97 at the Police Prevention Unit. The basic characteristics of all surveyed police officersare provided in Table

The basic characteristic of the examined police officers presented in Table
1
showed
that examined women were significantly older than men.  Moreover, the group of men
was characterized by significantly higher body weight and body height, as well as by
significantly higher BMI values. Examined female officers were characterized by a higher
percentage of body fat.
Statistical analysis performed within the group of men and women (Table
2
) revealed
significant differences in body height of both men and women depending on the service unit.
Trainees in the Department of Police Cynology, both women and men, were significantly
shorter in height in relation to their colleagues in the Police Prevention Department and
Water Police Training Base, respectively.
The analysis of the body weight and height measurements enabled the calculation of
BMI and, in consequence, permitted assigning respondents to appropriate groups accordingto the WHO classification described in Section
2
.  None of the surveyed officers were
underweight, while over 65% of the examined subjects had increased body weight. Theseabnormalities were found in one-third of the surveyed women, whereas this percentage
was 71.4% in men. According to WHO criteria, 50.2% of all respondents were overweight,
including 22.9% women and 55.6% men.  Obesity was found in 14.9% of all surveyedofficers, including 10.4% of women and 15.8% of men. Such a significant number of obese
people in service is alarming since it may contribute to developing cardiovascular diseases
and other metabolic civilizational diseases, resulting in their release from service.
BMI does not always provide reliable results for an assessment of body composition,
especially in the case of physically active people, since its value may result from highmuscle mass and not from high-fat content in the body. Therefore, finding abnormalitiesin body weight should be based on also on total body fat content.  For this reason, weconducted a body adipose tissue measurement to calculate the FMI index. The Fat MassIndex (FMI) calculation ensures a more reliable approach as it differentiates muscle andfat mass of the total body weight.  Hence, from a clinical point of view, while assessinganthropometric components of nutritional status, both BMI and FMI should be used ascomplementary tools.  The results of the assessment of the nutritional status of policeofficers based on the fat content are summarized in Table

Total body fat content (FMI) analysis revealed the presence of excessive fat tissue in 31.8%
of all subjects. Overweight and obesity resulting from high-fat content were found in 34.9%of men and 16.7% of women. Consequently, we compared the number of candidates withexcess body weight according to the BMI with the measured body fat level. This comparisonshowed that excessive body mass in 36.5% of men and 16.7% of women results from musclemass and is not a type of overweight that may be hazardous to health. On the other hand, allsubjects with excessive body fat were characterized by abnormalities in BMI.
An adequate supply of calcium is significant for maintaining the proper structure and
functioning of the human skeletal system. The content of this mineral, in addition to geneticdeterminants and the degree of physical activity, is an essential factor influencing bonemass. Therefore, achieving the maximum values of peak bone mass, the main prognosticfactor for the risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis is essential in preventing the mentionedbone pathophysiological conditions [
17
].
The proper status of Police officers’ bone calcification is vital due to the physical
burden of the training process and the realization of specific tasks related to this training
process. Maximum skeletal calcification, known as peak bone mass, occurs between 25 and
35. This age range is also the period in which most new candidates for service in the Policeare admitted. Our study of Police officers’ mineral nutritional status covered 276 officers,including 67 women and 209 men. Bone calcification was assessed based on the T-score
value—above or below the expected value for the population of young, healthy people,
according to the ranges presented in Section
2
.
Densitometric tests revealed that 26.6% of the respondents suffered from disturbances
in bone mineralization of varying severity, and when separated by gender, it concerned52.3% of women and 18.7% of men (Tables
5
and
6
).

The densitometric tests revealed the alteration of bone calcification in female officers
regardless of the place of service. We found that 4.6% of the surveyed police officers hadchanges characteristic of osteoporosis, while bone changes characteristic of osteopenia oc-curred in 47.7% of the surveyed females. The most significant number of female
officers (20)
with altered skeletal calcification characteristic of osteopenia was found among women
trained at the Police Academy, while the highest percentage (66.6%) was found among
women in the Police Training Center (Table
5
).

The analysis of the results of densitometric tests in male officers revealed changes in
skeletal calcification in all three research sites, and it mainly concerned disorders characteristicof osteopenia (Table
6
). The highest percentage of officers with bone density disorders was
observed in the Police Academy and the lowest was observed in the Police School in Słupsk.
4. Discussion
Since service in the Police is considered a dangerous occupation, it is required that
the potential candidate is in excellent health condition [
18
].  Police officers are a profes-
sional group particularly exposed to work-related stress, which may have a negative effecton the health condition.  Numerous studies suggest that exposure to both chronic and
work-related stress is associated with an increased risk of civilization diseases, including
obesity, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) [
19
,
20
].  Research in
this area shows a higher incidence of diseases, especially cardiovascular diseases, among
police officers than in other professional groups [
21
].  This observation is supported by
epidemiological reports showing a higher incidence of obesity among police officers in
relation to non-police employees [
22
,
23
]. Hence, it seems extremely important to study the
relationship between body composition and the risk of diet-related metabolic diseases asthey may be essential in monitoring the health of police officers. Consequently, obtainedobservations and results enable the implementation of appropriate preventive measures,
which is the main tenet of the National Health Program, partly presented in this paper.
The presented research studies were conducted at the places of service of police
officers, which is why we based on measurements performed with mobile equipment. Bodycomposition assessment is a valuable and accessible tool enabling the simple evaluation of
physical fitness and health as it results from various factors such as diet, stress, the intensity
of physical activity and other daily habits [
24
,
25
].
The assessment of nutritional status elements based on anthropometric measure-
ments and BMI revealed excess body weight in the majority of examined Police officers.
These results were different depending on the place of the research and ranged from
60.0% to 69.1%. The fact that 71.8% of all male participants and 35.4% of women are over-
weight is disconcerting. According to the classification of nutritional status based on BMI,
25% of the women and 56% of men were overweight, while obesity was found in 10.4%and 15.8%, respectively.  These results align with observations made among uniformedservices in recent years, similarly to the civilian population [
26
].
As we indicated earlier, the assessment of overweight and obesity based on BMI values
may not be reliable for adults with increased physical activity and high muscle mass. BMIcannot distinguish between fat mass and lean mass; thus, it is advisable to determine thefat mass and calculate Fat Mass Index (FMI). This indicator assesses the degree of fatnessand not the entire body weight, which in the case of a police officer may result in extensivemuscle mass, increasing the BMI. The synthesis of those parameters seems to be an optimalapproach as it can provide information about the actual number of obese people. The totalbody fat content measurement in police officers showed that 31.8% of all respondents hadincreased adipose tissue content.  What is essential is that every subject with excessivebody fat also had excessive BMI. By sex, irregularities in the body fat content of varyingseverity were found in 16.7% of female officers and 34.9% of female officers. In our study,the average BMI among Police male officers was above reference values, while the average
% fat level and FMI were adequate in both sexes. Our previous research regarding polish
soldiers confirmed similar observations [
26
].
The prevalence of overweight and obesity among police officers is also a significant
health problem in other countries. Although the physical demands of police work suggestthe importance of maintaining a healthy body weight, studies have shown that 40.5%of U.S. police officers are obese [
27
].  A similar result was observed in another study of
276 U.S. police officers, where the obesity rate of male police officers was 41.9% [
28
]. These
observations are supported by a study of the nutritional status of 160 Saudi Arabian policeofficers, where overweight or obesity was found in 66.9% of respondents [
29
].
46

IJERPH

Another measure of nutritional status essential for police officers is bone mineral
density (calcification). A low value of this parameter leads to osteopenia and osteoporosis.Osteoporosis is a condition that affects the bones, causing them to become weak and fragileand more likely to break (fracture). Changes in bone mass occur due to complex regulatorymechanisms based on genetic factors and the nervous and humoral systems [
30
]. The role
of an adequate supply of calcium and its content in the body for the proper functioningof the skeletal system is indisputable.  However, it should be noted that the content ofthis element in the body undergoes dynamic changes [
31
].  Therefore, it is essential to
achieve the maximum values of peak bone mass, which is the main prognostic factor forthe risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis and to monitor bone calcification in the preventionof osteoporosis. This is of particular importance among police officers, as it allows for theearly detection of disorders and appropriate therapy and avoiding fractures, which may bethe reason for dismissal from service.  In the presented study, only half of the examined
women revealed a proper BMD (T-score above
−
1); changes typical of osteopenia were
found in 47.7% of subjects, while osteoporosis was found among three of 67 examined
women. Significantly better results were obtained in the case of men, as bone calcification
disorders concerned only about 20% of the studied population and features of osteoporosis
were found in less than 1% of the respondents.
Due to the lack of similar research among police officers, the obtained results can be
applied to soldiers who are also subjected to similar conditions of service and training. Our
previous research on soldiers trained similarly to candidates in police schools showed that
osteopenia and osteoporosis were found in 19.2% of respondents under 30 and 7.4% ofsoldiers over 30 [
32
].  On the other hand, studies performed among Polish Land Forces
soldiers revealed adequate bone calcification in 75% of soldiers aged up to 30 and among90% of soldiers aged over 30 [
33
]. Similarly, 77% of soldiers returning from a mission in
Afghanistan, aged up to 30, and 87% of soldiers aged over 30 were characterized by an
adequate bone calcification [
34
].
5. Strengths and Limitations
The presented research has several strengths.  First, it may be considered a unique
study as there are limited numbers of studies among police officers in Poland that assess theelements of the nutritional status (anthropometry, body composition, and bone calcification).Moreover, we focused on three nutritional status indicators: indicators of protein-energystatus describing body size (BMI) and obesity (FMI) and indicators of mineral nutritionalstatus (BMD T-score) that are considered essential in the evaluation of police officer’shealth and suitability for the service.  The results of bone calcification are unique sincethere are no studies evaluating this aspect of nutritional status among police officers inPoland. Third, based on the body composition and densitometric analysis, we revealedsignificant  abnormalities  in  Police  officers’  nutritional  status,  which  clearly  show  thenecessity to perform educational activities in the health promotion of uniformed services
(Police officers). These activities should be primarily focused on nutritional prevention of
nutrition-related non-communicable diseases and motivate police officers to respect thebasic principles of a healthy lifestyle.
One of the study’s limitations is the relatively small group (289 police officers). How-
ever, our research aimed to gain cross-sectional knowledge concerning the tested parame-ters of officers at their service places. Although the surveyed officers come from differentunits, this group is a representative sample of this uniformed formation. From the abovelimitation comes another one concerning using a DEXA-based apparatus for measuringbody composition. We agree that this method of collecting data concerning body composi-tion is optimal, but because the research study was carried out off-site in various placesof police service throughout the country, we used devices characterized by small size andmobility.  We agree that another limitation of the study is the lack of information on theother components of the nutritional status (nutrition and physical activity). However, sincethe presented work is part of the National Health Program project, these results will be
47

, 7161
presented in another work comparing research on diet and physical activity in different
uniformed services.6. Conclusions
The presented results on elements of the nutritional status of police officers showed
the disturbing occurrence of nutritional disorders, especially obesity. This is particularly
worrying as it proves an unbalanced nutrition model in terms of energy, predisposing to the
development of diet-dependent metabolic civilizational diseases. Moreover, the observedbone calcification disorders in police officers indicate an improper state of mineral nutrition,
predisposing them to an increased bone fractures.
The reported abnormalities and disturbances in police officers’ nutritional status
suggest the need to train staff responsible for planning and implementing mass catering tooptimize the nutrition and nutritional prophylaxis of metabolic diseases. Moreover, theobtained results justify the need for performing educational activities in health promotionand developing a guide on the principles of rational nutrition and prevention of diet-relateddiseases, taking into account the specific nature of the service in the Police.

Abstract:
The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of overweight and obesity among Polish
Armed Forces soldiers and to analyze risk factors impacting body mass. In total, 1096 male, Caucasian
soldiers (36.31
±
8.03 years) participated in this study.  Anthropometric data were obtained, and
questionnaires evaluated sociodemographic, environmental, behavioral and biological factors known
to be associated with obesity. Only 33% of the total number of participants had normal body weight,and 17.3% were considered obese (according to WHO criteria). The results showed that being 40 yearsor older, sleeping six hours or less per day, more frequent reaching for food in stressful situations,having a mother with excessive body weight, not exercising or exercising at most two days per week,and spending two hours a day or more in front of the TV increase the risk of obesity. Taken together,the results show that factors such as family history of obesity, dietary habits, physical activity, lengthof sleep and ability to cope with stress could be used to identify soldiers at higher risk of developingobesity in order to provide them with personalized prevention programs.Keywords:

1. Introduction
Epidemiological data indicate that overweight and obesity are two of the main public
health problems. They affect all age groups and countries all over the world regardless oftheir developmental stage [
1
–
4
]. According to a report by the World Health Organization
(WHO), the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased dramatically in the general
population over the past decades.  Now, 39% of adults worldwide are overweight and
13% are obese ([
5
](
https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-
overweight
, accessed on 27 August 2021)).
It is now widely accepted that occupational factors may play an important role in the
occurrence of excessive body weight [
6
,
7
]. Military personnel, as an occupational group,
are more exposed to stress, harmful environmental factors and limitations in food selectionor availability, especially during military exercises or military missions [
8
,
9
].
Studies have shown an alarmingly high prevalence of excessive body weight among
soldiers all over the world.  Soldiers fulfilling the criteria of obesity constitute 8% in theUS Army [
10
], 12% in the British Army [
11
], 13% in the Iranian Army [
12
,
13
] and 6% in
the Polish Air Force [
14
]. A higher percentage of soldiers with excessive body weight was
found in the Saudi Arabian Army, where obesity was diagnosed in 44% of soldiers [
15
].

Alarmingly high percentages of overweight and obese Polish soldiers, 58% and 27%,
respectively, in those over 50 years of age were reported by Gielerak et al. in the implemen-tation of the MIL-SCORE (Equalization of Accessibility to Cardiology Prophylaxis and Carefor Professional Soldiers) program, which aimed to assess the prevalence of cardiovascularrisk factors in a population of 6440 Polish soldiers [
16
].  According to the authors of the
program, the professional staff of the Polish Army, due to the specific conditions of perform-
ing their tasks, seems to be particularly exposed to risk factors for adverse cardiovascularevents. The results of the MIL-SCORE program showed the occurrence of hypertension in45% of soldiers and lipid disorders in more than half of the participants. Coronary heartdisease was diagnosed in 3% of Polish soldiers over 50 years of age and <1% of youngersoldiers. Diabetes affected 7% of the oldest soldiers and 3% of soldiers aged 40–50 years. Inthe age subgroup > 50 years, high and very high results of cardiovascular risk assessment
were observed in almost one-third of soldiers [
16
]. The results of the MIL-SCORE program
indicate that Polish soldiers have multiple cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity,
which reflect trends observed in the general population. This confirms the trends observed
in earlier studies [
17
].
The above studies on obesity among military personnel most often evaluated sociode-
mographic factors such as age, sex, marital status, military rank and employment. Only oneof these studies evaluated the effects of fitness and physical activity on body weight [
13
].
Risk factors contributing to the obesity epidemic are of interest to many researchers world-
wide. In particular, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
identifies economic, social and physical factors that have changed dynamically over the
past 20–30 years and have influenced diets and levels of physical activity at work, at home
and leisure time [
18
].  Other researchers have placed emphasis on lifestyle factors [
19
],
including particular attention to the impact of stress on weight gain [
20
,
21
].
In the present work,  as compared to previous studies on military personnel,  we
propose considering the simultaneous influence of a much larger number of environmental
and behavioral factors on the prevalence of obesity among Polish soldiers. These factorsinclude time spent in front of the television [
22
,
23
], time spent in front of the computer [
24
],
time spent sleeping [
25
], dietary factors (e.g., snacking, consumption of fast food and
sweets) [
26
], family history of obesity [
22
], leisure time activities [
27
] and the effects of
mood and stress on eating behavior [
28
].
To  our  knowledge,  despite  the  constantly  deteriorating  nutritional  status  among
soldiers of the Polish Armed Forces, no one has undertaken an investigation of the risk
factors for overweight and obesity in this professional group so far. In addition to assessingthe most important risk factors for the development of overweight and obesity amongsoldiers of the Polish Armed Forces, the aim of our work was to propose a model of the
probability of obesity based on risk factors.  Achieving these objectives will help design
more effective obesity prevention programs for these soldiers.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Participants
Full anthropometric and questionnaire data were obtained in a group of 1096 Cau-
casian men (36.31
±
8.03 years, mean body mass 84.94
±
14.84 kg, mean body height
177.56
±
7.35 cm
and mean body mass index (BMI) 26.85
±
3.95), soldiers of the Polish
Armed Forces (370 soldiers of the Navy, 283 soldiers of the Land Forces, 184 soldiers of
the Air Force, 86 soldiers of the Garrison Warsaw and 41 soldiers of the Territorial DefenceForces) from military units from all over Poland that have declared their willingness to
participate in the National Health Programme 2016–2020. The invitation to participate in
the National Health Programme was earlier sent to all commanders of the military units.If they agreed, invitations had been sent via e-mail to their subordinates.  All soldiers
who expressed their willingness to participate in the Program were enrolled. The researchwas conducted between April 2018 and October 2020. An additional 133 participants had
52

incomplete datasets and were not included in the analyses. All participants accounted forabout 1% of the Polish Armed Forces.
All procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Military
Institute of Aviation Medicine, Warsaw, Poland (decision No. 01/2018 of 9 March 2018),and have been performed in accordance with the ethical standards as laid down in the
1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. All
participants provided informed consent.
2.2. Study Design
Body height was measured with an anthropometer (Holtain, UK,
https://holtain.co.
uk/anth.php
, accessed on 20 January 2022) to the nearest 1 mm, in a standing upright
position, without shoes. Body weight was determined in underwear alone, after emptying
the bladder.  Participants were categorized on the basis of BMI based on World HealthOrganisation (WHO) criteria (5). Three groups were created: BMI in the range 18.5–24.9
(normal), BMI in the range 25.0–29.9 (overweight) and BMI
≥
30.0 (obese).  Participants
with a BMI < 18.5 were not included.
2.3. Instruments for Data Collection
A research questionnaire was used to identify obesity risk factors. The questionnaire
asked about age; education; size of the community; being obese as a child/teenager; body
weight at the age of 18; family history of obesity; number of meals consumed and their
size; feeling satiated after eating; snacking during the day and at night; time of eatingthe last meal before bedtime; consumption of sweets, fast-food products, sugar, salt and
water; eating in front of the TV/computer; paying attention to the caloric value of meals
and food labels; number of days during the last week (7 days) when the respondent didmoderate physical exercise; time spent in front of the TV; length of sleep; and ability tocope with stress. Respondents completed the survey in an online version. All procedures
were performed in the morning hours.
2.4. Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated: mean, standard deviation and median. Com-
pliance  with  the  normal  distribution  of  quantitative  variables  was  checked  using  the
Shapiro–Wilk test. The Kruskal–Wallis analysis of variance was used to check the differ-
ences between the three groups (depending on the BMI categories). A chi-square test wasused to test for differences between participants’ BMI categories and obesity risk factors.
The multivariable logistic regression was applied to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical analyses were performed using PS IMAGO PRO 7
(IBM SPSS Statistics 27, Armonk, NY, USA). The level of statistical significance was set at
p
< 0.05.
2.5. Logistic Regression Model
Due to the fact that the effect of increased BMI may be related to expanded muscle mass
(so-called muscular overweight), which is relatively common among soldiers [
29
–
31
], only
groups with BMI corresponding to normal body weight and obesity were used to determinethe odds ratio (OR) of BMI
≥
30 for the risk factors in question. Overweight participants
were not included in the analyses, as this group might have included participants with
normal body fat and increased muscle mass. Logistic regression was used to calculate the
probability of obesity in the study group of professional soldiers, depending on risk factors
and their combinations.  OR was calculated for factors that were found to be significantin initial verification using the chi-square test.  The OR indicates how many times therisk of obesity (BMI
≥
30) is higher in the group of participants with a given risk factor
compared to the group of participants without the same risk factor.  The model of the

Based on the equation presented, the probability of obesity in the absence of risk
factors as well as in the simultaneous presence of four risk factors was calculated.3. Results
The mean age of the respondents participating in the study was 36.31
±
8.03 years.
The mean BMI of all participants was 26.85
±
3.95.   Only 33% of the total number of
participants had normal body weight, 49.6% were overweight and 17.3% were considered
obese (according to WHO criteria).  The mean values per BMI group are presented in

The soldiers at normal body weight were younger (33.78
±
7.59 years) than soldiers
with diagnosed obesity (39.93
±
7.71 years). Most (50.7%) of the respondents lived in a city
of more than 100 thousand inhabitants, 30.9% lived in a city of fewer than 100 thousandinhabitants and 18.4% lived in the countryside; 55.4% of the respondents were persons
with higher education, and the rest of the soldiers had secondary education. Residence and
education level of the participants had no significant effect on their body weight (
p
< 0.05).
The soldiers belonging to respective BMI groups showed no significant differences in
the reported number of consumed meals per day, snacking between main meals, snacking
at night, time of last meal consumption, salt intake, fast-food consumption, amount ofconsumed water, paying attention to the calorie content of meals, reading food labels oreating in front of TV. The results are presented in Table
2
.  Participants with BMI
≥
30
reported being significantly more likely to be overfed after meals (
p
= 0.016) and to reach
for food when experiencing negative emotions and bad mood as compared to participants
with normal BMI (28.9% vs. 10.8%) (
p
= 0.0001). Soldiers with BMI
≥
30 were significantly
more likely to sweeten beverages as compared to soldiers with a normal body weight
(47.4% vs. 57.7%) (
p
= 0.002).

In response to the question concerning body weight in childhood, most of the re-
spondents declared that they had a normal body weight (76.3%), 11.4% declared that they
were overweight, 2.3% declared that they were obese and 10.1% declared that they were
underweight (Table
4
). Soldiers with BMI in the obese range were significantly more likely
to report excessive body weight in childhood (
p
< 0.001).  In response to the question
regarding body weight at age 18, 82.2% declared that they had a normal body weight, 8.7%declared that they were overweight, 1.3% declared that they were obese and 7.8% declaredthat they were underweight.

Regarding the prevalence of obesity in parents, 62.7% of the soldiers at normal weight
declared that their mothers were or had been of normal weight and 66.7% that their fathers
were or had been of normal weight. Soldiers with obesity were significantly more likely to
declare that their parents were overweight or obese (
p
< 0.001) as compared to soldiers at
normal weight. Detailed results are presented in Table
4
.
Interestingly, salting, eating sweets, eating fast food, snacking between meals, the
time of the last meal before bedtime and snacking at night did not differ between soldiersbelonging to the three groups (Table
2
above).

The results of the analysis showed that six or less hours of sleep per day increased
the risk of obesity by 74% (OR = 1.74; 95% CI: 1.19–2.54) in the study group with respectto those who slept seven or more hours (Table
5
). More frequent reaching for food when
experiencing negative emotions and bad mood and well-being increased the risk of BMI inthe obese range by almost 4 times (OR = 3.64; 95% CI: 2.12–6.22) in relation to participants
who declared they forgot to eat at that time or these situations did not influence their
eating behavior.

Soldiers whose mothers were overweight or obese were almost 3 times more likely to
develop obesity (OR = 2.86; 95% CI: 1.98–4.14) than soldiers whose mothers’ weight wasnormal. In contrast, those whose fathers were overweight or obese were almost twice morelikely to develop obesity (OR = 1.78; 95% CI: 1.23–2.57).
Participants who did not exercise or exercised at most two days per week had more
than 2 times the risk of obesity relative to those who reported exercising at a moderatelevel at least three days per week (OR = 2.28; 95% CI: 1.59–3.27). Participants who spenttwo or more hours a day in front of the TV had a 54% higher risk of obesity as comparedto those who did not watch TV at all or watched no more tha

95% CI: 1.07–2.23).
Soldiers aged 40 years or older were more than 4 times more likely to develop obesity
as compared to their younger counterparts (OR = 4.46; 95% CI: 3.04–6.55) (Table
5
).
In the next analysis, the risk factors for obesity in the studied group of soldiers shown
in Table
5
were entered into a logistic regression model. On the basis of multivariate analysis,
the following factors remained statistically significant: reaching for food in situations of

experiencing negative emotions and bad mood and well-being, excessive maternal body
weight, practicing moderate-intensity physical activity less than 3 days a week and age
over 40 years. Detailed results of the obtained logistic regression model are presented in
Table
6
.  In the absence of risk factors, the probability of obesity in the studied group of
soldiers was 12.2%, while in the case of the simultaneous occurrence of four risk factors,
the risk of obesity was up to 86.9%.

4. Discussion
The emergence of obesity as a distinct disease could have far-reaching consequences
for an organization where optimum health and physical fitness are required for personnelto perform their occupational roles effectively [
32
]. Our survey found a 17% prevalence of
obesity in the Polish Armed Forces. This percentage is higher than that in the American,French, English or Iranian armies [
10
–
13
] but lower than that in the Saudi Army [
15
].
According to a report published in 2021 by the National Institute of Public Health–
National Research Institute, in Poland, overweight occurs in 52.4% of men and 32% of
women, and obesity occurs in 16.5% and 16.2%, respectively. The prevalence of overweight
and obesity in the Polish military is comparable to that in the general male population inPoland ([
33
] (Accessed on 20 January 2022).
As in our study,  age was also one of the most significant risk factors for obesity
among soldiers in the Saudi Arabian [
34
], American [
10
,
35
], French [
13
] and UK armed
forces [
11
,
36
].   The fact that obesity increases with the age of soldiers is worrying,  as
it  suggests  that  obesity  develops  while  serving  in  the  Armed  Forces,  contrary  to  our
expectations [
37
].
Smith et al. [
35
] note that age was associated with obesity among military personnel,
most likely as a result of gaining small amounts of weight over many years.  We agree
with the thesis of Quertier et al. [
13
], that this relationship could result from changes in
employment type, such as from active operational roles to more sedentary posts, which
induce weight gain.
We observed in the study group that the probability of obesity among soldiers who
had an obese mother is 26%, which is consistent with the literature [
38
]. However, in our
case, not only obesity of mothers but also obesity of fathers was associated with a higher
probability of BMI
≥
30 in soldiers [
39
,
40
]. According to many authors [
22
,
23
], children of
obese parents prefer a sedentary lifestyle, are more likely to consume high-calorie foodsand spend more time in front of the television.
Reaching for food when experiencing negative emotions and a bad mood proved to be
another highly significant risk factor for the development of obesity in the studied cohortof soldiers. Stress is significantly related to nutrition [
28
]. It can alter overall food intake in
two ways, causing malnutrition or overeating, which can be influenced by the severity ofthe stressor [
21
]. People seek to minimize the feelings of tension that accompany stressful
situations by using the means available to them. Since food is often readily available andan immediately effective way of discharging emotions, it is often used to alleviate theeffects of stress. Evidence from longitudinal studies suggests that chronic life stress may be
58

IJERPH
2022
,
19
, 3069
causally linked to weight gain [
21
], consistent with our results. Studies by other authors
also confirm that chronic occupational stress and a lack of social support at work are riskfactors for obesity [
20
,
41
,
42
]. Therefore, it seems important to create programs to reduce
stress among professional soldiers.
A modifiable lifestyle factor strongly associated with obesity among soldiers was
also time spent sleeping and watching TV per day.  Too much time watching televisionis also a lifestyle component associated with obesity, due to lack of exercise and/or fre-
quent snacking promoted by TV watching [
43
]. Our results are consistent with previous
studies showing an association between overall time spent in front of a screen and obesity,demonstrating that reducing time spent in front of a screen can reduce the prevalence ofoverweight and obesity [
44
]. Thus, the reduction of screen time should be considered for
weight management programs.
There is consistent evidence that the amount of sedentary behavior (or low physical
activity) is associated with higher levels of body fat [
45
]. In the military community, as in
the general population, too little physical activity is also cited as one of the risk factors forobesity [
13
]. In this study, the probability of obesity in soldiers who spent less than three
days per week on moderate exercise was 20%. In our study, 23.4% of soldiers who reportedmoderate physical activity up to two days during the last week had obesity. In the groupof respondents who declared performing physical activity at least 3 days per week, 12%had obesity. In comparison, in Quartier ’s study [
13
], 16% of servicemen who reported less
than2hof
physical activity were obese, while the obesity prevalence was only 8% among
those practicing 2 t
o 4 h per week and 6.6% for members undertaking at leas
t4ha
week.
Sleep is one of the main dependent factors, besides physical activity and diet, leading
to the maintenance of good health and thus is important among soldiers. Too little sleepcauses metabolic and endocrine changes, including decreased glucose tolerance, decreasedinsulin sensitivity, increased evening cortisol levels, increased ghrelin levels, decreasedleptin levels and increased hunger and appetite [
46
]. Epidemiological studies have found a
significant association between short sleep (typically < six hours per night) and increasedrisk of obesity [
44
]. A meta-analysis of 18 studies involving 604,509 adults found a pooled
odds ratio (OR) for obesity of 1.55 (1.43–1.68) for less than five hours of sleep [
25
]. It was
also estimated that for each additional hour of sleep, BMI decreased by 0.35.  Our ownresearch found that six or fewer hours of sleep per day increased the risk of obesity by 74%among soldiers.
Analysis of the study results showed that not all risk factors for obesity present in the
general population were significant in this study group, such as eating sweets, eating fastfood, snacking between meals or snacking at night.Limitations
The selection of personnel was based on availability rather than on any particular
characteristic associated with obesity.  BMI alone may overdiagnose obesity because itdoes not take into account the real muscle mass, which is larger in soldiers than in thegeneral population [
29
,
31
].  However, we used BMI to divide participants into groups
to be consistent with the literature and to allow comparisons.  It should be noted that
soldiers in the obese range, but not in the overweight range, have an increased amount ofbody fat (e.g., [
31
]).  Therefore, in the majority of our analyses, we compared soldiers at
normal weight with soldiers with BMI exceeding 30 to minimize this bias. Nonetheless, ourresults are consistent with reports originating from other armies, as well as with generalknowledge about obesity and its causes.5. Conclusions
Overweight and obesity prevalence in the Polish Armed Forces is similar to that in
other armies of developed countries and in the general population of Poland. Analyses ofthe results of the National Health Programme implemented in 2018–2020 clearly indicatethat the level of existing efforts to prevent overweight and obesity among professional
59

IJERPH
2022
,
19
, 3069
soldiers in Poland is insufficient. The results show that factors such as family history ofobesity, dietary habits, physical activity, length of sleep and ability to cope with stress couldbe used to identify soldiers at higher risk of developing obesity in order to provide them
with personalized prevention programs. Therefore, therapeutic interventions to reduce the
prevalence of overweight and obesity among Polish soldiers should include self-monitoring
of body weight especially after the age of 40, nutritional education, physical activity at least
three days a week and psychological support for individuals who eat when experiencingnegative emotions.

Abstract:
A maximum plank hold (PH) has been implemented in the Army Combat Fitness Test
(ACFT) with the Holistic Health and Fitness (H2F) program. The H2F program introduces a shift in
wellbeing from a fitness centered approach to framework also comprising nutrition, sleep, mental,
and spiritual components. The purpose was to analyze how a maximum PH correlated with fitness,lifestyle behaviors, and mood states in tactical athletes (TA) and assess differences between those
who pass and fail. Forty-nine TA completed fitness testing, lifestyle behavior, and mood state surveys.
Bivariate correlations were used to examine relationships with PH performance.   PH time wassignificantly correlated with total body mass, fat mass, BMI, push-ups, and state physical energy
(SPE). VO
2max
was significantly different between the groups who passed and failed the PH. PH was
not associated with lifestyle behaviors or trait mood states. PH performance could vary day-to-dayas it was correlated with SPE. Individuals with poorer aerobic fitness and body composition may beat risk for failing the PH.Keywords:

1. Introduction
Tactical  athletes  (TA)  are  composed  of  law  enforcement,  firefighter,  and  military
personnel. Physical aspects of TA’s duties require muscular strength, muscular endurance,power,  agility,  speed,  anaerobic,  and aerobic fitness [
1
,
2
].   Deficiencies in any area of
fitness may compromise safety, mission success, and increase risk of musculoskeletal injury.Despite a robust list of physical requirements needed to complete varying occupationaltasks, fitness tests for TA have historically emphasized local muscular endurance andaerobic fitness [
3
,
4
]. Research has concluded that these fitness tests provided an incomplete
assessment of TA’s occupational readiness and need to assess more areas of fitness relatedto job tasks that require high levels of force and power production [
5
]. Thus, attempts have
been made to establish new fitness testing protocols to better assess all realms of fitnessassociated with occupational tasks [
6
].
The Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) was developed by the United States (U.S.)
Army to replace the Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT) that had been in use for four
decades [
3
]. To assess core function, the ACFT now replaces the APFT’s sit-up assessment
with the plank hold (PH). The ACFT assesses soldiers against an age and gender-scaled
standard [
6
].  Notably,  the PH is now the only event graded against a gender-neutral
standard. Due to scrutiny over the ACFT, a congressionally mandated independent reviewby the RAND Corporation was conducted to better determine the efficacy of this newoccupational fitness assessment. This review found incomplete evidence to support the useof the ACFT in the Army’s soldiers and no conclusive evidence to support the leg tuck orPH event predicting performance on combat tasks or injury risk [
7
].
Traditionally, TA fitness assessments have utilized maximum sit-ups as a measure
of local core muscular endurance [
3
]. As a result, the majority of previous literature has

correlated only the sit-up event with performance on fitness tests and military occupa-tional tasks [
8
]. Meta-analyses have shown only weak to moderate significant correlations
between sit-up performance and performance on occupationally specific tasks [
8
].  The
PH event requires isometric contraction of the total core and has been correlated with
performance on tasks that are integral to TA such as marksmanship, balance, one-repetition
maximum box lift, and ruck march performance [
9
–
11
]. Greater core strength, endurance,
and stability may also reduce the risk of injuries [
12
].  While aspects of TA occupational
duties may differ, TA present similar injuries.  Military [
13
], law enforcement [
14
], and
firefighters [
15
] all frequently report low back pain. Historically, sit-ups have been used to
assess core endurance but evidence suggests that sit-ups can increase compressive forcesin the lumbar spine, a contraindication for individuals with low back pain [
16
]. The PH
is easy to implement in tactical athlete populations and has more validity than sit-ups inassessing core endurance and predicting injury risk [
17
]. Likewise, PH training has been
shown to reduce low back pain [
18
].
In recent decades, a holistic approach to wellness has been adopted by the military, fire,
and police departments. Concomitantly with the ACFT, the U.S. Army is implementingthe Holistic Health and Fitness (H2F) program. The H2F program represents a paradigmshift from physical fitness being viewed as the primary determinant of solder readiness toholistic framework comprising nutrition, sleep, mental, and spiritual, along with physical,components.  Law enforcement agencies [
19
] and firefighter departments [
20
] have also
begun adopting more holistic views of tactical athlete health. Moving forward, in additionto promoting physical fitness, there is an emphasis on healthy lifestyle behaviors andmental health [
21
,
22
]. The “Big 3” modifiable healthy lifestyle behaviors of sleep, physical
activity, and diet have been positively correlated with mental health and well-being inadults [
23
].  Unfortunately, the shiftwork and unpredictable hours of TA’s occupations
often lead to sleep deprivation, long hours of sitting, and poor diets [
24
,
25
]. Poor lifestyle
behaviors can, in turn, have a negative effect on TA’s mental and emotional health andultimately, performance and longevity.
Worsened mental health (i.e., depression) can present as feelings of lower energy
and higher fatigue. State and trait mental and physical energy and fatigue may influence
physical performance and have been shown to be correlated with balance which could
influence injury risk [
26
].  Negative mood states have been associated with decreased
performance on a ruck march in the summer at U.S. Army Ranger School [
27
]. Interestingly,
certain personality types may be less likely to adopt unhealthy lifestyle behaviors.  Forexample, the personality trait known as grit (i.e., the inclination to pursue long-term goals
with sustained interest and effort over time) appears to have a positive influence on living
a healthy lifestyle in terms of the “Big 3” modifiable behaviors [
28
]. Moreover, grit has been
reported to be associated with better physical performance in U.S. Military Academy cadets
and increased retention in a U.S. Army Special Operations Forces selection course [
29
,
30
].
Thus, state and trait energy and fatigue, grit, and mood states may be factors influencing
operational readiness in TA.
The primary aim of this study was to examine whether the maximum PH performance
is associated with common fitness assessments, modifiable lifestyle behaviors (i.e., sleep,diet, and physical activity), as well as moods and personality in TAs.  We hypothesizedthat  PH  performance  would  be  positively  associated  with  body  composition,  aerobicendurance, and upper body muscular endurance as well as healthy lifestyle behaviorsand grit.  Given the recent adoption of the maximal PH assessment on the ACFT andgender-neutral scoring, there is some uncertainty of the implications of the pre-determinedcut-off time to determine passing, or failing, of the PH. Thus, a secondary aim was to assessdifferences in fitness, lifestyle, and health between those who pass and fail the PH eventbased on ACFT standards. We hypothesized that those who passed the PH event would befitter and report living a healthier lifestyle. Our analyses utilized an approach similar tocurrent holistic frameworks of performance optimization employed by a majority of TAorganizations.

2. Materials and Methods2.1. Experimental Approach to the Problem
A cross-sectional observational design was used in which participants were required
to complete a standardized testing battery. Testing was completed during a single 90-minsession and each participant was tested individually.  Participants were asked to avoidstrenuous exercise up to 48 h before testing and avoid food or fluid intake other than waterfor 2 h before testing. Upon reporting to the laboratory, participants completed an informedconsent followed by a series of electronic questionnaires regarding moods, personality, andlifestyle behaviors. Once the questionnaires were completed, anthropometric measures (i.e.,height, mass, and body composition) were obtained. Participants then performed a series ofmovement assessments (i.e., wall sit and reach, Y-balance test, overhead squat, and Apleyscratch test). Next, a dynamic warm-up was performed before completing the followingfitness assessments in this order: countermovement jump, 1-repetition maximum bench
press, pull-up, push-up, PH, and maximal oxygen consumption test. All participants wereprovided familiarization and standard instructions for the assessments. All test sessions
were conducted by researchers at George Mason University.  For all testing sessions, at
least one of the researchers present was a National Strength and Conditioning AssociationCertified Strength and Conditioning Specialist.2.2. Subjects
The sample of the study consisted of 49 (males = 41, females = 8) tactical athletes
(law enforcement officers,
n
= 29; firefighters,
n
= 20) 38
±
7.8 years of age with 12
±
8.3
years of service. Participation in the study was purely voluntary and there were no formal
requirements to participate as part of their employment. Participants were recruited viaemail and flyers. To be eligible for the intervention, participants were required to: (1) beeither recruits or currently employed emergency responders in Northern Virginia; (2) nothave surgery or injury in the last 3 months; (3) ability to run, perform pull-ups, and push-ups without pain; (4) no history of cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, or metabolic disease;and (5) engage on average 30 min of physical activity daily. All participants were informedof the benefits and risks of the study and signed the informed consent.  The study wasapproved by George Mason University’s Institutional Review Board (IRB #: 12179B). Data
was collected using appropriate safeguards to protect participant’s identifying information.
All procedures were conducted in accordance with best practices related to ethical issues in
exercise science research [
31
].
2.3. Procedures
The order of testing was the same for all participants. Upon arrival to the testing facility,
participants completed the informed consent and questionnaires.  The anthropometric
measurements were then taken. The movement and fitness assessments were performedafterwards.  To minimize the effect of fatigue, each participant was given exactly 5 minof rest between fitness assessments.  Participants performed a dynamic warm-up usinga standard and supervised procedure to minimize risk of skeletal muscle injury duringfitness assessments. Rest periods were derived from pilot testing of the protocol.2.4. Questionnaires
Participants completed a series of electronic questionnaires to assess lifestyle behaviors,
personality, and mood states. The order in which the questionnaires were completed was
as follows.2.4.1. Energy and Fatigue
The mental and physical energy and fatigue scale was used to measure the complexity
of mental energy, mental fatigue, physical energy, and physical fatigue. The validity andreliability of this instrument has been supported by the work of Boolani et al. [
32
] and
O’Connor [
33
]. State responses were assessed on a 100-point scale from “never” to “always”.
65

Trait responses were assessed on 10-point scale from “never” to “always”.  Participants
completed mood state questionnaires prior to and following 90-min of strenuous exercise.
The Cronbach’s alpha for trait and state mood were as follows: trait physical energy = 0.92,
trait physical fatigue = 0.87, trait mental energy = 0.82, trait mental fatigue = 0.91, state
physical energy = 0.78, state physical fatigue = 0.91, state mental energy = 0.73, and state
mental fatigue = 0.94.2.4.2. Grit
The 8-item short grit scale (Grit-S) was used to measure grit, defined as perseverance
and passion towards long-term goals [
34
].   An aggregated score was divided by 8 to
determine total grit scores ranging from 1 (not at all gritty) to 5 (extremely gritty).  The
Cronbach’s alpha for the current study was 0.76.2.4.3. Diet
Dietary behaviors were assessed via the Rapid Eating Assessment for Participants
Short Version (REAP-S), a 16-item questionnaire including 13 items addressing first partfrequency of food choices (i.e.,  In an average week,  how often do you:  Eat less than2 servings of fruit a day?) and 3 items addressing the will to change dietary behaviors [
35
].
Higher summation of the first 13-items were indicative of healthier diets.  Participantsreporting <5 scores of 1 were categorized as having good diets and participants with
≥
5 scores of 1 were categorized as having poor diets. The REAP-S questionnaire has good
test-retest reliability and is a valid instrument when compared with the Healthy EatingIndex (r = 0.472,
p
< 0.001) for measuring dietary behavior [
35
]. The Cronbach’s alpha for
the current study was 0.71.2.4.4. Sleep
The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was self-reported to assess sleep quality.
The PSQI is a 19-item questionnaire that scores seven components: subjective sleep, sleep
latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleep medication, anddaytime dysfunction. A total sum is then reported as an overall PSQI global score. Partici-
pants were categorized as ‘good’ and ‘bad’ sleepers. Good sleep was quantified as a PSQI
global score that is less than or equal to 5, while bad sleep is a PSQI global score of morethan 5. Using frequency of distribution, we defined the top and bottom third of PSQI scoresas extreme values of good and bad sleepers (PSQI
≤
3 and PSQI
≥
7). The PSQI survey
has demonstrated acceptable test-retest reliability (r = 0.87), high sensitivity (98.7%), andspecificity (84.4%) [
36
]. The Cronbach’s alpha for the PSQI for the current study was 0.73.
2.4.5. Physical Activity
Participants were asked to self-report physical activity (PA) through the International
Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF), a 7-item scale including the fre-
quency (exercise sessions per week), duration (minutes per session), intensity (light, mod-
erate, vigorous), and time spent seated (hours and minutes) over the previous seven-day
period. The IPAQ-SF has a moderate to high degree of reliability with Interclass Correlation
Coefficients (ICC) between 0.71 and 0.89 [
37
,
38
].
2.5. Anthropometric Measures
Height and weight were recorded to the nearest 0.01 cm and 0.01 kg, respectively,
using a stadiometer (Detecto, Webb City, MO, USA) and digital scale (BOD POD; CosmedUSA, Concord, CA, USA). Percent body fat, fat mass, and fat-free mass were measuredusing air displacement plethysmography (BOD POD model 2000A; BOD POD, CosmedUSA, Concord, CA, USA) following standardized procedures by the manufacturer.  Airdisplacement plethysmography has been shown to be a reliable and valid method ofassessing body composition [
39
].

2.6. Movement Assessments2.6.1. Wall Sit and Reach
The WSR test was administered to determine flexibility using the methods described
in the study by Liemohn et al. [
40
].   Trials were measured in cm.   The WSR has been
previously reported to be a valid (r = 0.77) and reliable (ICC = 0.95) test to assess lumbosacral
flexibility [
41
].
2.6.2. Y-Balance Test
The YBT device (Functional Movement Systems, Chatham, VA, USA) was used to
collect dynamic postural stability data following the methods described by Wright et al. inthe anterior direction [
42
]. Performances were measured in cm. The YBT has been reported
to be valid and reliable [
43
].
2.6.3. Overhead Squat and Shoulder Mobility
To assess hip mobility, participants completed 3 repetitions of an overhead squat. The
overhead squat was performed and assessed in accordance with the Functional MovementScreen
™
protocol [
44
].   Shoulder mobility was assessed using the Apley Scratch Test.
Participants were instructed to make a fist with each hand. Then, they reached one arm
overhead, with their fist behind their neck, and reached the other arm to the small of theirback, reaching upwards as far as they can [
44
]. Distance between participants’ fists was
measured in cm. All steps were repeated for the measure on the other side. The functionalmovement screen deep squat and Apley Scratch assessments have been reported to havestrong inter-rater and intra-rater reliability [
45
].
2.7. Fitness Testing2.7.1. Countermovement Jump
The countermovement VJ was used to measure lower body power. Participants per-
formed the VJ assessment directly following a dynamic warm-up.  Instructions were touse a countermovement technique and jump as high as possible on each attempt. Partici-
pants were given 2 warm-up jumps at 50% and 75% effort, respectively. Three attempts
were completed, and the highest jump height was recorded.  The VJ was performed on
a timing mat (Just Jump, Perform Better, Cranston, RI, USA). The use of flight time to
measure jump height has been reported to be valid for assessing countermovement jump
performance [
46
].
2.7.2. Upper Extremity Muscular Fitness Testing
Common upper extremity muscular fitness tests were performed to profile the upper
body pushing and pulling ability of participants. A 1RMBP was used to assess upper bodystrength. The 1RMBP has been reported to have good to excellent test-retest reliability [
47
].
Posterior upper body muscular endurance was measured with pull-ups to failure. Anteriorupper body muscular pushing endurance was measured with push-ups to failure. Theseassessments were conducted following a previously published protocol [
48
].
2.7.3. Prone Forearm Plank
Core muscular endurance was assessed with a prone forearm PH for maximum time.
Participants were required to perform the PH with forearms on the ground, elbows at 90degrees, and contacting the ground directly below the shoulders.  The head, shoulders,hips, knees, and ankles were required to be in a straight line during the test. The posture
was the same as required by the ACFT PH assessment.  A demonstration of the correct
posture was provided prior to the start of the test.  Instructions were to “keep a straight
line between your shoulders, hips, knees and ankles” and “hold the position as long as
possible”. The researcher began the timer when the participant initiated the PH. The timer
was stopped when the participant exhibited volitional fatigue or noticeable degradation in
form of the PH. At no point in the test were participants informed of the duration of the
67

IJERPH
2022
,
19
, 12832
PH. Once subjects were in the correct position, the test began exactly 5 min following the
push-up assessment. During the testing, subjects were provided 1 warning if they began to
deviate from the correct posture. Time was recorded to the nearest second on a stopwatch.
The isometric prone PH has been reported to be a valid and reliable assessment of core
muscle function [
49
].
2.7.4. Maximal Oxygen Consumption
Participants completed the Wellness-Fitness Initiative (WFI) Treadmill ramp protocol
which has been validated in tactical athlete populations [
50
]. Peak VO
2
was assessed; tests
were terminated due to an RER
≥
1.15, plateau, or reduction in exercising heart rate with
an increase in workload, or volitional fatigue. Breath-by-breath indirect calorimetry wasmeasured by a calibrated metabolic cart (TrueOne 2400, Parvo Medics, Salt Lake City, UT,USA). Heart rate was continuously recorded with a wearable chest strap monitor (H10,Polar-Electro, Kempele, Finland). Physiological variables were continuously monitored andrecorded during all stages of the test. Exertion was self-reported at each stage of the test
via the 15-point (6–20) Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale. Prior to that start of
the VO
2max
, participants were shown a visual of the 15-point RPE scale and were verbally
instructed that 6 was considered extremely easy (i.e., laying down watching television) and20 was maximal effort (i.e., pushing a boulder up a mountain). In the last 30-s of each stage,the researcher held up the RPE visual and participants were verbally instructed to point tothe number that corresponded with their physical efforts.2.8. Statistical Analysis
The data collected, analyzed, and presented in this study are from a larger on-going
project. Recently, survey questionnaires to assess personality and mood were added to the
testing protocol. This led to a total sample size of 49 for anthropometric, movement, andfitness measures, but only 18 participants completing the additional measures of lifestyle,
personality, and mood states. The data reported are not the primary focus of the on-goingproject and as a result, apriori sample size calculations were not conducted.  However,
apriori sample size calculations in G*Power (version 3.1.9.7, Heinrich-Heine-UniversitatDusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany) were computed for correlations (tails = 2, alpha = 0.05,
power = 0.8) and for large effects, a sample size of 26 would be adequate.  Data were
compiled, cleaned, and scored into Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Inc., Redmond, WA, USA).Normality was assessed with Shapiro–Wilk test and visualized with Q-Q plots. Normalitytesting revealed that a PH was normally distributed,  but a majority of data were notnormally distributed.
Spearman Rho rank tests were run to determine correlations between PH and measures
of body composition, fitness, personality, and mood states. Duration of PH was transformed
into a dichotomous variable of “Pass” or “Fail” based on the cut-off times set by the U.S.
Army [
51
]. The composition of the groups were as follows: (1) Anthropometric, movement
and fitness measures:  Pass group:
n
= 41, males:  35, females:  6, fire:  17, police:  34; Fail
group:
n
= 8, males: 6, females:2, fire: 3, police: 5; and (2) Lifestyle, personality and mood
state measures:  Pass group:
n
= 16, males:  15, females:  1, fire:  1, police:  15; Fail group:
n
= 2, males: 2, females: 0, fire: 0, police: (2) Group differences between those who passed
cut off times and those who did not were determined with the use of Mann–Whitney Utests. Effect sizes of Mann–Whitney U tests were determined with the Glass rank biserialcoefficient (rg) and interpreted as small (rg = 0.11 to <0.28), medium (rg = 0.28 to <0.43),and large (rg
≥
0.43) [
52
]. Sex differences in fitness variables were assessed, following the
primary analyses, with Mann–Whitney U tests. All analyses were completed using the R
Environment and packages psych, car, Rcdmr, mlogit, ggplot2, devtools, and WMWssp (RFoundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), alpha was set at <0.05.

3. Results
All demographic, fitness, lifestyle behaviors, personality traits, and mood state vari-
ables are provided in Table
1
. The majority (84%) of the sample met the ACFT standards for
the PH. Although not statistically significant, the group that did not meet the ACFT PH stan-dards self-reported greater durations of total PA (Pass: 762.82
±
797.19, Fail:
835
±
855.60),
but the group who met the standards engaged in greater VPA (Pass: 261.25
±
141.76, Fail:
135.00
±
148.49, rg = 0.500).  A large effect for VO
2max
(
p

hold duration (
p
< 0.001, rg = 0.948) were found to have significant group differences
between those who passed and failed the PH determined by the ACFT standards (Table

).
PH duration had weak, negative correlations with fat mass (

).  For fitness parameters, PH duration was found to
have a weak positive correlation with maximal push-ups (
ρ
= 0.29,
p
= 0.045) (Table
3
).
Additionally, PH duration had moderate, positive correlation with state physical (
ρ
= 0.61,
p
= 0.047) energy (Table
4
). There were no significant correlations between PH duration and
variables for grit, lifestyle behaviors, and personality traits. PH time was the only fitnessvariable for which males did not outperform females (
p

4. Discussion
The main purpose of this exploratory study was to analyze how a maximum PH corre-
lated with body composition, fitness, lifestyle behaviors, and mental and emotional healthin TA. A secondary purpose was also to assess how those variables differ between those
who pass and fail the event. The results of this exploratory study partially supported our
hypothesis as it was found that PH time was negatively related to several measures of bodycomposition (i.e., fat mass, BMI) and positively related to upper body muscular endurance
(i.e., maximum push-ups). Additionally, we did find that those self-reporting greater state
physical energy performed better on the PH. When we categorized participants into “Pass”
and “Fail” groups based on the ACTF standards, VO
2max
values were significantly different
between the groups. Unexpectedly, there were no other significant differences in measuresbetween the “Pass” and “Fail” groups. It is noteworthy that lifestyle variables and grit werenot significantly associated with PH performance; however, our sample was small andrather homogenous in regard to many of these variables, which likely affected our findings.4.1. Plank and Body Composition
Despite routine fitness testing, being overweight and obese is prevalent in the U.S.
military, law enforcement, and firefighter populations [
53
,
54
].  Individuals classified as
overweight or obese may display decreased athletic performance. Obese firefighters dis-
played 27% lower back and core endurance scores than their non-obese counterparts in
a study by Mayer et al. [
54
]. In the current study, 82% of the sample were categorized as
overweight and 10% were considered obese per BMI standards.  Additionally, negative
correlations were observed by Mayer et al. between BMI and body fat percent with core andback endurance [
54
]. Similarly, in the current study fat free mass and BMI were negatively
correlated with PH outcomes. Two of the “Big 3” modifiable lifestyle behaviors, physicalactivity and diet, can directly contribute to BMI and fat free mass. Thus, individuals at riskfor performing poorly or failing the PH due to poor body composition may benefit from aholistic approach rather than strict PH training.

4.2. Plank and Fitness Assessments
VO
2max
was the only fitness assessment that was significantly different between PH
pass/fail groups. These findings were not unexpected as core endurance training has been
found to increase running economy, VO
2max
, and running performance in both fit and
unfit populations [
55
,
56
]. Greater core endurance may lead to better running economy and
efficiency which would contribute to better performance on aerobic fitness assessments.For example, in U.S. Army soldiers, PH performance has been found to be moderatelycorrelated with time to complete a 3200 m march with a 25 kg load [
11
].
Push-ups were the only fitness assessment significantly correlated with PH perfor-
mance. This was expected because push-ups require an individual to maintain their bodyin a straight line, such as a plank. Because proper push-up form requires core endurance,testing both in the same session may lead to increased fatigue on the latter event. However,due to the weak correlation, the two assessments may not be redundant and may not
warrant the exclusion of one of the two from the ACFT using criteria similar to that of
Cesario et al. [
57
].  Practitioners should provide adequate rest periods between the two
assessments for their TA to reduce the risk of carry over fatigue.4.3. Plank & Mobility/Balance
Greater core strength and endurance has been found to be correlated with a decreased
risk of musculoskeletal injury in athletes and general population [
12
,
58
]. Likewise, YBT
and FMS outcomes are indicators of injury risk in tactical athletes [
59
].  Thus, core en-
durance, YBT, and FMS outcomes are of importance to tactical strength and conditioning
professionals. Previous literature found moderately-strong correlations between PH out-
comes and single-leg balance in soldiers [
10
]. Similarly, a significant, weak correlation was
found between PH and FMS scores in firefighters and between trunk flexor and extensorendurance and FMS scores in military personnel [
60
,
61
]. However, the current study found
no significant relationship between a maximum PH and YBT outcomes in TA. It is possibleno relationship was found in the current study because only the anterior portion of the YBT
was tested. Additionally, we found no significant relationship between PH and outcomes
of the FMS overhead squat and the Apley Scratch shoulder mobility test. Okada et al. alsofound no significant correlations between core stability and FMS scores [
62
].  Therefore,
core endurance may contribute to injury risk in a different way than the components ofthe YBT and FMS, and thus, all three assessments may complement one another when
ascertaining injury risk.4.4. Plank & Health Behaviors
Despite assessing numerous lifestyle and health behaviors and moods, PH perfor-
mance was only significantly correlated with state physical energy in this population of TA.In regard to lifestyle behaviors, this finding can be interpreted as living a healthy lifestyledoes not by itself equate to greater levels of fitness and vice versa (i.e., being fitter doesnot mean one necessarily displays healthy lifestyle behaviors). Furthermore, it has beenreported that state and trait physical and mental energy were indicators of postural controland gait [
26
]. The PH is an event that requires isometric control of a specific posture, thus,
the physical energy of a TA on that specific testing day may be one of the greatest contrib-utors to performance. Grit has been previously correlated with physical performance incadets and active duty military [
29
,
30
]. It is plausible that because the TA in the current
study scored similarly on levels of grit, the lack of variability resulted in non-significant
findings. Previous research has used larger populations where even small differences in gritmay be reflected in performance and positively influence engagement in healthy lifestylebehaviors [
28
,
63
].
4.5. Limitations & Future Research
The sample population was comprised of professional law enforcement officers
(
n
= 29)
and firefighters (
n
= 20).   Anecdotally,  numerous participants mentioned a history of
72

IJERPH
2022
,
19
, 12832
prior military service; however, it was not formerly documented as part of the researchprocedures. In comparison, the Active Duty U.S. Army mean age is 27.0 years for enlisted
soldiers and 34.7 years for officers with a male:female ratio of 83:17 [
64
].  However, the
current sample population has body composition and fitness outcomes similar to thatof an Active Duty 101st Airborne Division cohort [
65
].  Regardless of population, this
is one of the first studies to analyze the PH’s correlation with body composition, fitness
assessments, and health and lifestyle behaviors. Most research with TA correlated the PH
with occupation specific tasks such marksmanship, balance, one-repetition maximum box
lift, and ruck march performance [
9
–
11
,
62
]. Outside of that, a majority of research utilizing
TA examines the sit-up event [
66
]. Therefore, comparisons and contrasts between results
must also consider utilizing research on athletes and the general population.
A main limitation of the study was the modest sample size. Post-hoc power analysis
indicated that for the anthropometric, movement, and fitness data, the correlations wereadequately powered;  however, the lifestyle, mood, and personality variables had low
power (<0.80) due to the smaller sample size (
n
= 18).  Another limitation was that the
PH was included in battery of assessments that could have induced fatigue prior to the
plank. However, the ACFT and other occupational physical fitness assessments also include
several assessments, thus making the current results more generalizable to test batteriesrather than stand-alone assessment.  Once more ACFT data is available, future researchshould assess the PH event in soldiers and how it may correlate with other ACFT events,body composition, and health and lifestyle behaviors. Moreover, data used in this study is
part of an ongoing project; a recent addition of subjective measure to the methodology lead
to a small data pool in terms of self-reported measures. Small variance in the subjectivemeasure independent variables is not ideal for analyses and likely affected our findings.Due to the nature of fitness assessments, it is plausible that participants did not give theirbest effort during testing. All participants were given the same instructions and similarlevels of encouragement during testing to maximize the likelihood of best effort. However,because participation was voluntary and performance was not consequential to their jobs,unlike the ACFT, participants may not have given full effort. Lastly, due to time constraints,only two of the seven FMS assessments were given. Thus, a composite FMS score could notbe given. Future research should administer the entire FMS and YBT tests and ascertainhow they may relate to performance on the entire ACFT.5. Conclusions
The US Army has recently adopted the maximum PH event as part of their annual
fitness testing (i.e., ACFT) despite limited literature supporting its use to predict occupa-tional performance or injury. Considering the variables associated with PH performance
(i.e., body mass index, fat mass, push-ups, state physical energy), as well as the only vari-
able within this study that was significantly different between PH pass and fail groups
was VO
2max,
there are several preliminary conclusions that can be provided from this
exploratory study.  First, while the PH event is considered a test of core endurance, not
aerobic fitness, it seems the two fitness measures may be intertwined and those with pooraerobic fitness are more at risk for failing the event. Additionally, individuals with greaterBMI and fat mass may display worse performance on the PH. The lack of difference inPH performance between males and females in the study provides support for the PH asa ‘gender neutral’ assessment. Thus, to improve PH performance, it would be suggestedthat strength and conditioning practitioners implement training to enhance VO
2max
and
body composition. In regard to PH assessment it is appears that a TA’s physical energy ona testing day may influence their PH performance. Factors such as the time of day testingoccurs, testing after a shift, or testing groups of TA together could all influence physicalenergy [

]. These should be documented to aid in interpreting individual results over
multiple tests on the same individual.

Abstract:
Background: Chronic inflammation can lead to the development of obesity, diabetes and
other chronic diseases. One of the factors causing inflammation is diet. The aim of this study wasto assess the inflammatory potential of the diet, expressed by the DII index, in young physicallyactive men. Methods: A total of 94 physically active students aged 19–23 participated in the study.
The subjects’ diets were assessed on the basis of 4-day dietary records, which were then analyzed
using the computer program “Diet 5.0”. The DII was calculated for each participant based on the
individual consumption of the selected dietary components. The concentration of CRP protein wasalso determined. Results: Participants was divided into groups according to values of DII. Diets withdifferent DIIs provided similar amounts of calories, but differed significantly in the content of manynutrients. Participants whose diets showed the most anti-inflammatory effects consumed significantlymore protein, magnesium, iron, zinc, antioxidant vitamins, and B vitamins compared to others. Thehighest concentration of CRP protein was observed in men whose diet was described as the most
pro-inflammatory (Q4 group). A significant relationship was found between DII and body fat (%) in
men in the most anti-inflammatory (Q1 group) and neutral diet (Q2–Q3 group). Conclusions: TheDietary Inflammatory Index is a promising method of describing the effect of dietary intake on therisk of inflammation in young, healthy individuals engaging in regular physical activity.Keywords:

1. Introduction
Inflammation is a defensive reaction of the immune system to a pathological factor
that damages cell structures. It is the natural response of any healthy organism to neutralize
pathogens and maintain homeostasis. The normal inflammatory response occurs when the
threat is present and resolves when the threat is over [
1
,
2
]. However, the action of certain
biological, psychological, social, and environmental factors can prevent acute inflammationfrom subsiding and contribute to the persistent presence of chronic inflammation in thebody.  Chronic inflammation is characterized by the activation of the immune systemcomponents that often differ from those involved in an acute immune response [
3
]. Shifting
the inflammatory response from short-term to long-term leads to severe changes in thefunctioning  of  all  tissues  and  organs,  which  can  increase  the  risk  of  various  diseasesin both young and old people.  Long-term inflammation in the body is now linked tothe development of chronic non-communicable diseases such as obesity, diabetes, andcancer [

,

].
Factors contributing to the development of long-term inflammation include chronic
infections, lifestyle-related obesity, intestinal dysbiosis, sleep disturbances, psychologicalstress, social isolation and environmental and industrial pollution [
2
]. According to existing
data  low  physical  activity  and  poor  diet  also  contribute  to  the  occurrence  of  chronic

associated with long-term inflammation has been well documented [

,
8
].  It is assumed
that lack of physical activity promotes inflammation as it causes the body to store morefat, especially visceral fat [
9
].  It is also believed that in physically inactive people, the
intensification of inflammation is a result of the reduced secretion of anti-inflammatory
substances by the skeletal muscles. These substances are cytokines (e.g., IL-6, Il-8) and othersmall proteins (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF, irisin) called myokines [
10
]. It
should be emphasized that myokines are produced by skeletal muscles and have systemicanti-inflammatory effects primarily during muscles’ contraction [
11
]. Decreased production
of myokines in physically inactive people is associated with increased pathophysiologicalchanges typical of chronic inflammation, including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia andhigh blood pressure [
12
].  On the other hand, exercise-induced damage to muscle fibers
is known to cause transient inflammation which, if overtrained, can turn into chronicinflammation [
13
].  Thus, the relationship between exercise and inflammation is more
complex and depends on many factors.
The same goes for diet. For example, following a Mediterranean Diet based mainly
on fruits, vegetables, fish and other products containing many unsaturated fatty acids isassociated with the reduction of inflammation [
14
]. In turn, the Western Diet, very popular
in developed countries, characterized by a high consumption of saturated fatty acids andsimple carbohydrates, contributes to a significant increase in the level of inflammatorymarkers in the blood (e.g., C-reactive protein, CRP). It has been shown that these nutri-ents negatively affect the intestinal microflora, and by increasing the permeability of theintestinal barrier, they cause inflammation [
15
].
A growing number of studies confirming diet influence on the occurrence of inflam-
mation have contributed to the creation of an indicator called the Dietary InflammatoryIndex (DII) [
16
,
17
].  DII was established in 2013 on the basis of numerous publications
from 1950 to 2007, which described the influence of 45 food components, then includedin the DII, on inflammation development [
18
].  Each component of DII was given an in-
dividual positive or negative point value.  Positive values were assigned to ingredients
and/or products that exhibit pro-inflammatory properties (e.g., saturated fatty acids), whilenegative values were assigned to ingredients and/or products with anti-inflammatory
properties (e.g., vitamins, minerals) [
19
]. This relatively new dietary index was validated
against inflammatory cytokines [
20
,
21
]. The studies conducted so far have also confirmed
its relationship with the occurrence of components of the metabolic syndrome, such as high
waist circumference, high TG concentration or hypertension [
22
]. Thus, the development
of the Diet Inflammatory Index allowed for a better assessment of the quality of consumedfood, mainly in the context of its impact on health.
Previous studies which analyzed DII mainly concerned middle-aged and elderly
people, often in the early or advanced stages of the disease (e.g., cancer, diabetes) and
characterized by moderate physical activity.   For example,  a large 2017 United States
study looked at ethnically diverse people aged 45–75 participating in the cancer registry
program [
23
]. This study confirmed an association between the pro-inflammatory potential
of the diet,  described by the DII index,  and an increased risk of colorectal cancer.   Inanother study by Visseres et al., the relationship of DII with the development of arterialhypertension was investigated in women aged 51–53 years [
24
].  Therefore, data on the
value of the Diet Inflammatory Index of healthy young people are insufficient. Meanwhile,
the few existing studies show that the diet of young people, especially men, often promoteschronic inflammation, thus increasing the risk of diseases related to it [
25
,
26
].
Taking into account the above information, as well as the importance of proper nutri-
tion for maintaining high physical performance, it seems advisable to undertake researchon the inflammatory potential of the diet, expressed by the DII index, in young, physicallyactive men.

2. Materials and Methods2.1. Subjects
Students of the J
ó
zef Piłsudski University of Physical Education in Warsaw, whose
physical activity results only from participation in sports activities provided in the studyprogram, took part in the study. The duration of physical activity ranged from four to seven
hours/week. Additional inclusion criteria for the study were: being healthy, not takingmedications, not smoking, and consenting to participate in the study. Participants wererecruited on the basis of advertisements in student dormitories and by word-of mouth.Originally, it was planned to recruit 100 physical education students. This many studentsagreed to participate in the research. However, complete data were obtained in 94 youngmen aged 19–23 years.
The study protocol has been approved by the J
ó
zef Piłsudski University of Physical
Education Ethics Committee. Participants were informed about the purpose and proceduresof the research and provided their written consent.2.2. Anthropometric and Biochemical Measurements
Assessment of the basic anthropometric parameters, i.e., body weight and height,
was performed using standard methods and equipment.  Height was measured to the
nearest
0.5 cm
and  body  weight  was  measured  to  the  nearest  0.1  kg.   Based  on  both
parameters, body mass index (BMI) was calculated.  Waist (cm) was measured using a
standard, retractable, non-metallic tape at the midpoint between the lower rib and the topof the iliac crest. Waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) was calculated. Body fat content (%) wasassessed by the bioimpedance method (BIA) in the tetrapolar version using the BC-418device (Tanita Co., Tokyo, Japan).  The following values of body fat percentage 14–17%
were accepted as characteristic for lean men [
27
].
Anthropometric measurements were carried out in duplicate and then averaged. All
measurements were taken by the same researcher, in the morning with the participants
wearing sports outfits without shoes.  Students were asked to arrive at the laboratory
during 0800–1000 h after an overnight fast, and to refrain from exercise for 24 h priorto body composition analysis and blood collection. Blood for hs-CRP concentration wasdrawn from the antecubital vein by an authorized laboratory technician. hs-CRP concen-tration was measured by an immunoturbidimetric method with latex reinforcement usingspectrophotometry. The blood was centrifuged (10 min; 3000 rpm), then the plasma wascollected and hs-CRP was determined. The reference values for the study were <0.5 mg/dL,
while the concentration of hs-CRP protein above 10 mg/dl indicates inflammation.
2.3. Diet Assessment
Dietary  assessment  was  made  on  the  basis  of  the  nutrition  records  from  4  days
(
2 weekdays,
2 weekend days). Weekday notes were collected in the presence of a trained
employee. Notes from weekend days were made by each participant, previously instructedon the correct recording method.  Study participants were asked not to use any dietaryrestrictions while collecting nutritional data. To identify the size of consumed portions, the
“Album of photos of products and dishes” developed at the Institute of Food and Nutrition
was used [
28
]. The content of selected nutrients and energy was calculated using the “Diet
5.0” computer program, also developed at the Institute of Food and Nutrition in Warsaw.2.4. Calculation of Dietary Inflammatory Index
The DII values were calculated according to the method proposed by Shivappa et al. [
18
].
To calculate the DII for each participant, the individual consumption of products and diet
components were used. These values were normalized to the mean global consumption
value (Z-score) and converted into the percentile score (PS). The PS parameters were then
recalculated to a symmetric distribution to “0” (centered percentile value (CPV)) with
values from “
−
1” (maximum anti-inflammatory) to “1” (maximum pro-inflammatory).
The CVP values obtained for individual products/nutrients were then multiplied by the
79

IJERPH
2022
,
19
, 6884
overall inflammatory effect score, which allowed the obtaining of the DII for individualdietary components. After summing up the DII values of all analyzed diet components, thetotal DII for each study participant were calculated [
18
]. Of the 45 original DII components,
35 were available for this evaluation. Components such as flavan-3-ol, flavones, flavonols,flavonones, and antho-cyanidins included in the original DII calculation were not analyzedin the current study because they were not available from the computer program
“Diet 5.0”.
2.5. Statistical Analysis
The normality of the distributions has been checked using the Shapiro-Wilk test. The
significance of the differences between the groups depending on their distribution wasassessed either using ANOVA for normally distributed data or the Kruskal-Wallis rank
ANOVA for non-normalized data.  Results are presented as means
±
SD. Differences at
p
< 0.05
were considered significant. The relationships between the variables were assessed
by analyzing the Spearman’s simple correlation coefficients. The analysis was performed
with the use of Statistica v.10. (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, USA).
3. Results
The aim of the study was to determine whether young physically active men differ
in body composition and the concentration of inflammatory markers, depending on theconsumed diet described by the DII index.  In addition, an analysis was performed toidentify nutrients (DII components) that had the greatest impact on the pro-and anti-
inflammatory nature of young men’s diet. Therefore, the obtained data was divided into
quartiles (Q1; Q2; Q3; Q4) based on the values of the calculated DII. The following groups
were distinguished: the group with the most anti-inflammatory diet (Q1) with DII values
−
3.39;
−
1.05, the group with the most pro-inflammatory diet (Q4) with DII values 1.34;
4.23 and the group with the neutral diet (Q2–Q3) with DII values
−
1.03; 1.30.
The data presented in Table
1
show that the men included in the particular quartile
groups did not differ in body height and body mass, as well as in the content and dis-tribution of body fat.  The body fat content of all study participants indicated that they
were lean.

In all groups,  the anti-inflammatory DII values were determined mostly by fiber,
vitamin B6 and vitamin E (Figure
1
). In the Q1 group, the anti-inflammatory nature of the
diet was also influenced by vitamin C, vitamin A, beta-carotene, zinc and magnesium. Thesame minerals had a significant impact on the health-promoting DII values in men from theQ2–Q3 group. Conversely, total calorie intake and the amount of consumed fat, includingcholesterol, increased the pro-inflammatory properties of the diets of all the surveyed men.
The consumption of saturated fatty acids showed such an effect only in the diet of subjects
from the Q1 and Q2–Q3 groups. It was also observed that the pro-inflammatory DII in menfrom Q4 group was significantly influenced by vitamin C and beta-carotene (Figure
2
).
The highest concentration of hs-CRP protein was observed in men from the Q4 group,
whose diet was described as the most pro-inflammatory. However, this difference reached
statistical significance only compared to the Q2–Q3 group (
p
< 0.05) (Figure
2
).
There was no statistically significant correlation between the hs-CRP protein concen-
tration and the DII score in the group following the most anti-inflammatory diet (Q1) as
well as in the group following the most pro-inflammatory diet (Q4) (Table
3
). However, a
statistically significant relationship was found only between this dietary index and bodyfat (%) in groups Q1 and Q2–Q3 (
p
< 0.05) (Figure

).

4. Discussion
Nutrition has a significant impact on the health and psychophysical development of
every human being, from the prenatal period to later old age. An appropriate diet is con-ducive to proper course of the growth process, maintaining a normal body weight in adultlife and protecting against the effects of aging (e.g., sarcopenia, osteoporosis) [
29
–
31
]. It is
well known that proper nutrition is also important in the prevention of numerous diseases:
metabolic (e.g., obesity, diabetes), respiratory system (e.g., asthma), circulatory system
83

IJERPH
2022
,
19
, 6884
(e.g., atherosclerosis, heart disease), as well as cancer and mental diseases (e.g., depres-
sion) [
18
,
32
–
35
]. Conversely, bad nutritional habits contribute to increased inflammation in
the body, which leads to the development of these diseases [
36
,
37
].
There is no doubt that physically active people should be characterized by a properly
balanced and healthy diet [
38
]. The aim of this study was to calculate the Diet Inflammatory
Index for young men with moderate and regular physical activity and to use it to evaluatethe impact of diet on their health.  The DII values observed in this study ranged from
−
3.39 to 4.23.  This range of DII score was comparable to those reported by Akbaraly
et al. (
−
3.35 to 4.23), who studied the relationship between DII and recurrent depressive
symptoms in a large British population of adult men and women aged 35–55 years [
39
].
In comparison, the diets of obese men and women aged 43.4
±
10.9 years studied by
Abdurahman et al. [
40
] were characterized by a DII ranging from
−
4.42 to 3.34, whereas
in Iranian adults participating in the Salari-Moghaddam et al.  project, which assessedthe relationship between DII and psychological disorders, it was found that DII valuesranged from
−
4.49 to 5.39 [
41
].  It seems that the differences in the DII values observed
by various authors can be largely explained by the number of components included inthe DII calculations.  This was the case of our study, in which, due to the limitations of
the program used to analyze nutritional interviews, 35 out of 45 components proposed byShivappa et al. [
18
] were used to calculate the DII. However, due to the fact that the “Diet
5.0” program is the recommended tool to assess the diet of the Polish population [
42
], it
was decided to use it in the research. Moreover, it should be emphasized that in this study
the pro-inflammatory nature of the diet was assessed only in men, while the authors of theabove-mentioned studies analyzed the values of DII in both sexes.
It is worth quoting here the results of the analysis by Steck et al., who showed that the
DII value for fast food diets is 4.0, and for these Mediterranean diet is
−
4.0 [
19
]. Comparing
this to the DII values obtained in the participants of our own research, it can be concludedthat among them were people (group Q4; DII: 1.34; 4.23) with a diet that was unfavorableto their physical fitness.  There is much evidence in the literature that consumption ofa pro-inflammatory diet may have a negative impact on physical performance due tothe  occurrence  of  insulin  resistance,  faster  development  of  muscle  fatigue,  as  well  as
prolongation of post-exercise regeneration [
43
].
This study showed that young men whose diets had different inflammatory potentials
did not differ in body shape and composition. The values of BMI and body fat content inall studied groups were within the normal range for young, regularly physically activemen [
44
]. This can be explained by a similar intake of calories in the diet by the surveyed
men from the quartile groups distinguished on the basis of the DII value. The similar dietenergy consumption was probably related to the fact that all participants of this study werestudents of the same university, following the same program, requiring a similar amountof physical effort. It should be assumed that the energy expenditure related to the physicaleducation program of studies makes the majority of students lean. However, it is disturbingto find that some students’ diets with pro-inflammatory DII values may reduce the healthbenefits of an active lifestyle.
The differences in the DII values of the students’ diets resulted from their different
composition. The anti-inflammatory nature of the students’ diet was primarily determinedby the higher consumption of protein, antioxidant vitamins, B vitamins, zinc, iron andmagnesium.  Other authors drew similar conclusions, stating that a properly composedanti-inflammatory diet should rely on a high intake of vitamins, minerals and substances of
plant origin (e.g., a macrobiotic diet) [
19
]. Our own research also showed that insufficient
fiber intake makes the diet more pro-inflammatory.   The observation that insufficientconsumption of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids applies to diets with ahigher DII also confirms the reports of other researchers [
45
]. Therefore, this study shows
that the diets of young active men are characterized by deficiencies of these nutrients, whichaccording to the literature negatively affects their health and physical performance [
46
].
However, the analysis of the physically active young men’s diets also gave quite surprising
84

IJERPH
2022
,
19
, 6884
results.  An example is the finding that vitamin C and beta-carotene increased the pro-inflammatory nature of the diet in most participants. This observation is difficult to explain,thus further investigations are needed.
As expected, the highest levels of hs-CRP were found in men whose diets had the
highest DII values (Q4 group). Although previous studies mostly confirmed the existenceof a relationship between DII and inflammatory markers [
18
,
47
], this study did not show
a significant relationship between hs-CRP and DII score in any of the groups.  Perhapsthis was due to the fact that our participants were healthy people, with generally lowhs-CRP values, within the normal range, whereas a statistically significant relationship wasobserved between the DII and the body fat content, which is considered to be an indicatorof the nutritional status.
The present study had some limitations to consider. First, the study participants were
young, physically active men, thus the obtained results may not be generalized. Second,
herbs and spices were excluded in dietary recall cause to lack of intake information. Third,there was a small sample size compared to other DII studies (men
n
= 94).
Besides these limitations, this study has several advantages. First, despite the simi-
larities in anthropometric measurements between groups, differences in DII values werenoticed.  This may indicate that DII may be the first and easy tool to detect health prob-lems despite the lack of visual symptoms (e.g., obesity).  Second, our results confirmedthat consuming diet with a high DII increases the risk of disease also in young physicallyactive people.5. Conclusions
To our current knowledge, this is the first study in which the DII for young Polish
people was calculated. The Dietary Inflammatory Index is very promising as it can detect
any inflammation depending on the diet one has. Due to its low cost, this method allows fora quick assessment of the quality of the diet and its impact on health. However, additionalstudies on the relationship with dietary inflammation are needed.

Abstract:
Since the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is a serious crisis in many countries
around the world, it is important to conduct empirical research aimed at identifying risks and factors
protecting the functioning of people affected by it. For this reason, the goals of the present research
were to determine the level of physical activity and the severity of symptoms characteristic of mental
disorders, cognitive disorders and the quality of social functioning, as well as the structure of therelationship between physical activity and psychosocial functioning of 226 women and 226 menduring the COVID-19 epidemic in Eastern Poland.  The research was conducted using the
IPAQ-
SF  Questionnaire
,
GHQ-28  Questionnaires
,
TUS  Test-6/9  version
,  the  original
SFS  Scale
and  a  self-
developed  sociodemographic  survey.   The  collected  data  indicate  that  women  as  compared  tomen show lower levels of weekly physical activity, walking, moderate activity, vigorous activityand quality of functioning in family relationships, but higher severity of mental health disorders,
somatic symptoms, functional disorders, depressive symptoms, cognitive disorders, perceptual workdisorders, attention deficits and higher quality of functioning in work relationships. On the otherhand, the structural model indicates that physical activity, interacting with mental health disordersand cognitive disorders, is positively associated with the social functioning of the respondents, andgender is the moderator of the occurring dependencies. This suggests that physical activity adapted tothe condition of health may be an important component of gender-individualized psychopreventiveinterventions.Keywords:

1. Introduction
The leading health and social problem in many countries around the world is the
coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.  Up to 6 August 2022, a total of 588,081,229 cases ofdisease were recorded in various regions of the world, including 6,434,821 deaths and
559,178,151 recoveries. In Poland, the reach of the epidemic is 6,093,571 people, of which
116,660 patients have died and 5,335,862 have already been cured [
1
].
Empirical evidence from different countries affected by the pandemic suggests that
symptoms of anxiety and depression (16.0–28.0%) and sleep disorders (38.9%), which areassociated with impaired cognitive dynamics and cognitive deficits, including attentionand perceptiveness [
2
,
3
], are relatively frequent psychological reactions to the current crisis
situation, with higher rates of symptoms of mental health disorders found in women thanin men [
4
–
6
]. On the other hand, both the occurrence of the above-mentioned symptoms
and the consequences of life limitations during the pandemic may disrupt the social life ofmany people, and thus lower the quality of their relationships with family members andfriends and professional interactions [

When attempting to understand the nature of the aforementioned crisis, it is important
to refer to the leading assumptions of the biopsychosocial model dominating in modernhealth sciences, which can explain intrapsychic reactions of people to the pandemic as aresult of the interaction of a network of equivalent biological, psychological and socialfactors shaping health [
8
–
10
].
Taking into account the biological factors included in the considered model, it should
be emphasized that empirical evidence from various countries affected by the pandemicindicates that gender moderates the resistance to stressors and has a significant influence on
psychological variables important in coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) transmission, specifically
mental health and cognitive processes [
8
–
12
].   On the basis of a meta-analysis,  it was
proven that women exhibit a higher intensity of symptoms characteristic of depressive
syndrome and anxiety disorders than men associated with the presence of attention and
perceptiveness deficits, which may indicate that it is more difficult for them to cope with
the current situation [
13
–
17
].
It was also observed that the mental condition and the state of cognitive processes
during the current crisis may be of significant importance for social functioning, includingfamily, interpersonal and professional interactions [
18
].  It is postulated that the quality
of these relationships is directly related to the received social support, acting as a factor
protecting against the negative consequences of experienced stress [
19
].
It has been observed that during the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, women report
a greater sense of loneliness than men [
15
,
17
].  Moreover, regardless of gender, in many
countries, including Poland, Spain, Australia, the United States, Sweden and China, dueto social isolation, quarantine, working from home and other pandemic restrictions, thenumber of social interactions decreased [
15
,
17
,
20
–
22
]. This at the same time reduces the
likelihood of receiving support, and thus increases the risk of developing unwanted psy-chological symptoms, including depression, anxiety disorders and accompanying problemsin cognitive functioning [
23
].
Bearing in mind that, according to the adopted approach, a human is a living sys-
tem, constituting an indivisible whole, composed of biological, psychological and social
dimensions, which, under the influence of incoming information, or, in other words, therequirements of the environment, remain in a dynamic balance, it is extremely importantto pay attention to factors supporting its remedial efficiency, and their consequences on thegeneral health condition [
9
,
10
].
One of the key forms of preventive action recommended by the World Health Organi-
zation (WHO) is regular physical activity, defined as any type of body movement initiatedby working muscles that causes energy expenditure. It includes walking, moderate and vig-orous activity, which, at the same time, strongly distinguishes it from other forms of leisureactivities, including time spent on passive leisure such as sitting and lying down [
24
,
25
].
The available literature shows that physical activity understood this way reduces
the risk of developing undesirable mental symptoms as well as disorders in cognitivefunctioning,  because  by  increasing  the  metabolism  of  kynurenine  and  the  expressionof kynurenine aminotransferase in skeletal muscles, it minimizes the consequences of
environmental stress, and thus prevents the appearance or reduces the severity of symptomscharacteristic to neuropsychiatric disorders [
26
].
It has been proven that systematic physical exertion delays neurodegenerative pro-
cesses and regulates monoamine metabolism, as well as neuroimmune functioning [
27
].
The physiological changes taking place under the influence of training support the proper
functioning of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA), the excessive activation of
which, caused by increased and sustained release of cortisol, is associated with the risk
of developing many disorders [
28
–
30
].  In addition, physical activity by stimulating the
expression of the brain nerve growth factor (BDNF), as well as supporting the proper func-tioning of the Trk-B receptor and BDNF-Trk-B signaling, determines the neurophysiological
processes taking place, which in turn has a beneficial effect on affective, cognitive and social
functioning [

The vast majority of studies indicate that men have higher levels of physical activity
than  women,  which  may  be  due  to  different  uses  of  the  time  available  in  the  courseof a day [
33
–
36
].  A nationwide study reported that, on average, men devote one hour
and thirty-three minutes per day to sports, while women, on average, perform physical
exercises for one hour and nineteen minutes per day. Moreover, men’s workouts tend tobe characterized by higher intensity than those performed by women. As a result, men’shigher physical activity, to a greater extent than women’s, may be a factor in protectingtheir mental fitness [
35
,
36
].
It is worth mentioning, however, that the results of studies conducted in different
regions of Poland are not consistent. For example, in the population of residents of north-eastern Poland, it has been shown that, although moderate physical activity is undertakenmore often by men (53.9%) than by women (34.7%), and that men, compared to the oppositesex, are almost twice as likely to ride a bicycle (31.5% vs. 13.1%), but at the same time it hasbeen observed that, regardless of gender, the physical activity of residents of this region isinsufficient and differs significantly from levels recorded in other parts of the country, as
well as in other European countries [
33
].
Results of a cross-sectional study conducted in a random sample of 6000 people
between the ages of 40 and 64 in Japan are also of interest. They came to slightly differentconclusions than the empirical works cited above. They observed that women, on average,spent 12.6% less time on sedentary lifestyles and 23.4% more time on low-intensity physicalactivity than men, but found no significant differences for moderate and vigorous physicalactivity [
37
].
This suggests that the conclusions of the empirical works published to date are incon-
clusive. The reported results vary depending on the region of Poland, as well as the part of
world in which they’re conducted [
33
–
37
], which at the same time suggests that they appear
to be worth supplementing. The results of our own research will therefore allow us to deter-
mine whether, and possibly to what extent, the observations of other researchers reflect thesituation of the people of Eastern Poland. Considering that there are no studies aimed atdetermining the level of physical activity, mental health, cognitive processes and quality ofsocial functioning, as well as the importance of interactions between these variables in the
population of women and men exposed to stress resulting from the COVID-19 epidemic in
Eastern Poland, the data obtained can provide both valuable scientific observation and beused to develop psychoprophylaxis interventions.
Hence, the aim of this own research was to determine the level of physical activity,
mental health, cognitive processes and quality of social functioning, as well as the structureof the relationship between physical activity and psychosocial functioning of women andmen during the COVID-19 epidemic in Eastern Poland.
Two research questions were posed accordingly:  (1) what is the level of physical
activity, mental health disorders, cognitive disorders and social functioning, as well as (2)
what is the significance of the interactions between physical activity, mental health and
cognitive disorders for the social functioning of men and women during the COVID-19
pandemic in Poland?
In response, two hypotheses were formulated, assuming that during the COVID-19
epidemic in Poland, depending on gender, the following varies: (1) the level of physicalactivity, the intensity of symptoms characteristic of mental health disorders, cognitivedisorders and the quality of social functioning as well as (2) the importance of the interactionbetween physical activity, mental health and cognitive disorders for social functioning.2. Material and Methods2.1. Design
While conceptualizing the author’s own research, the biopsychosocial model of health
was used [
8
–
10
].  Based on the above theoretical frameworks, in the quasi-experimental
model, a cross-sectional research plan was designed.

In line with the adopted theoretical approach, in this research project, variables of
biological (gender), psychological (physical activity, mental health disorders, cognitive
disorders) and social (social functioning) factors were distinguished, which were assumedto interact with each other.
Whereas the prognostic factors of mental health and cognitive disorders, as well as the
social functioning received, may vary depending on country and even region [
12
,
38
–
40
],
the analysis focused on the consequences of the epidemic in the population of EasternPoland, which means that the surveyed sample included only the inhabitants of theseareas. Additionally, the concept takes into account the moderating role of gender, as it is animportant biological determinant of susceptibility to physical activity, mental and cognitivedisorders and social functioning [
11
,
12
,
14
,
15
,
41
].
It was assumed that the mentioned parameters are latent variables, which is charac-
teristic of fully interactive approaches and at the same time allows for a detailed analysisof the mutual and multifaceted interaction of individual factors creating the structure of
physical activity, as well as shaping the state of mental health, cognitive processes and
social functioning [
8
–
10
,
42
].
Given that the biopsychosocial model of health [
9
], as well as numerous empirical
premises, suggests a significant role of sociodemographic factors for the variables analyzed
in the study,  during the conceptualization of the research,  many controlled variables,
which may potentially influence the results, have been taken into account [
13
,
43
,
44
]. They
include: gender [
14
,
15
], age [
43
], place of residence [
38
], level of education [
45
], marital
status, number of children [
15
,
46
], professional activity [
45
] and health condition of the
respondents [
7
,
47
,
48
].
In order to minimize the influence of gender on the obtained research results, the
analyzed groups were of the same size.  In the case of a health condition, a procedure
based on establishing its constant level was applied. Age, marital status, place of residenceand professional activity were checked by designating their subranges,  and,  as in thecase of the other above-mentioned variables, the homogeneity of the studied groups wasconfirmed [
42
].
In the first stage of the analysis, the level of physical activity, mental health disorders,
cognitive disorders and social functioning of women and men during the epidemic wereassessed.   In  the  next  stage,  the  focus  was  on  verified  gender-related  occurrence  andsignificance of the interactions and relationships between the identified variables based onthe modeling of structural equations in the confirmatory version.
The research was carried out in the population of adults of Eastern Poland in the
period from June, 2020 to December, 2021. In total, 579 people declared their willingness toparticipate, and 452 women and men met the inclusion criteria (78.7%). Before and during
the study, the participants showed no symptoms suggesting a risk of SARS-CoV-2 infectionand were not quarantined.
The research was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Helsinki Dec-
laration and received approval from the Bioethics Committee of the Medical Universityof Lublin (No.  KE-0254/100/2020, 28 May 2020).  The persons obtained all necessary
information and explanations about the project. In addition, they were informed about theconfidentiality of the data provided and about the possibility of receiving feedback basedon individual results.  In case of doubts, they had the opportunity to obtain additionalexplanations.
Due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and restrictions introduced in the country,
each person was contacted online. The invitation to participate in the research along withcontact details (telephone number, first and last names of persons to contact) was postedon the Internet on the website of NeuroCentrum [
49
]. It was available from 1 June 2020 to
the end of November 2021. The invitation to participate in the study was extended to adultresidents of Eastern Poland according to the adopted inclusion and exclusion criteria.
These inclusion criteria were: free and informed written consent to participate in the
research, age (adults), origin (inhabitants of Eastern Poland), marital status (married or
92

IJERPH

, 11860
partnership), employment based on an employment contract or contract of mandate, no
diagnosis of COVID-19 and a lack of SARS-CoV-2 symptoms, as well as good general
psychophysical health.  The exclusion criterion was:  failure to meet at least one of the
above-mentioned inclusion criteria.
Participants were recruited by phone. Those who declared their willingness to partici-
pate in the research, and at the same time met the inclusion criteria, provided the recruiter
with a telephone number and an address.  They were mailed an informed consent form
necessary to participate in the study, along with written information about the research
and a return envelope enabling the documents to be sent back. After receiving them, theindividuals were contacted by phone so a convenient date to carry out the study couldbe set.
The questionnaire session was carried out during individual video conferences. After
acquainting respondents with the rules of completing the questionnaire items, a sheet was
presented to them with individual questions, and the range of possible answers were read,
and answers were marked in the appropriate place on the test. On average, the research
period lasted for 20 min.
2.2. Participants
The sample consisted of two groups of inhabitants of Eastern Poland (
n
= 452). The
first was made up of women (
n
= 226), and the second was made up of men (
n

The analyzed groups were homogeneous in terms of age, number of children, place of
residence, education, marital status and professional activity.2.3. Physical Activity Measurements
The Short Form
Physical Activity Questionnaire
(
IPAQ-SF
) was used to measure weekly
physical activity. It contains seven questions about the time spent on activities that require
vigorous and moderate physical effort, as well as time spent on walks and time spent in
the form of passive rest (sitting, lying down).  Weekly exercise level can be estimated in
MET units (minute/week). It is the product of the activity coefficient for a specific activity,the number of active days and its duration in minutes. On this basis, the level of physicalactivity of the examined person is determined, which may be: (a) high—from 3 to 7 daysof intense physical exertion or at least 1500 MET; (b) sufficient—3 to 7 days of vigorous
93

IJERPH
2022

physical activity for at least 20 min a day or 5 to 7 days of moderate exercise/walking
for  at  least  30  min  a  day  or  5  to  7  days  of  any  physical  activity  that  in  total  exceeds
600 MET; (c) insufficient—lack of physical activity or failure to meet the conditions of thetwo above-mentioned levels [
25
,
50
].
2.4. Mental Health Measurements
The
General Health Questionnaire
(
GHQ-28
) was used to measure mental health. The
tool  is  used  to  assess  mental  health,  which  is  divided  into  four  dimensions:  somaticsymptoms, anxiety and insomnia, social dysfunction and symptoms of depression. The
GHQ-28
enables the identification of people whose mental condition has been subject to a
temporary or long-term breakdown as a result of experienced difficulties or as a result ofmental illness, and those who are at a significant risk of mental health disorders. The cut-off
point is a score of 12 or more. The questionnaire has high internal consistency and validity
rates.  The values of Cronbach’s
alpha
coefficients, calculated in the studied population
of women, ranged from 0.76 to 0.82, and in the population of men ranged from 0.76 to
0.83 [
51
].
2.5. Cognitive Functioning Measurements
The
Attention and Perceptiveness Test
(
TUS
) version 6/9 was used to measure cognitive
functioning in terms of attention and perceptiveness. The tool is used to assess cognitivedisorders in three dimensions: perceptual work, perception deficits and attention deficits.
The
TUS
enables the identification of people whose cognitive functioning condition has
been subject to a temporary or long-term breakdown as a result of experienced difficultiesor as a result of illness, and those who are at a significant risk of cognitive disorders. The
questionnaire has high internal consistency and validity rates. The values of the absolute
stability coefficients (3-week interval between tests), calculated in the studied populationof women, ranged from 0.77 to 0.81, and in the population of men ranged from 0.78 to 0.83.
The results were converted to sten scores [
52
].
2.6. Social Functioning Measurements
To measure social functioning during the COVID-19 epidemic, the
Social Functioning
Scale
(
SFS
) was used. This scale was constructed for this study. The tool was developed
on the basis of Falvo’s [
18
] concept of social functioning.  The
SFS
measures the quality
of  social  functioning  during  the  COVID-19  epidemic  in  three  spheres,  which  includefamily and interpersonal and professional relationships.  The test contains 21 questions
that respondents refer to on a six-point Likert scale. The answers range from
definitely no
to
definitely yes
.  The test validation and normalization procedure were carried out on a
sample of 700 adults. The content validity coefficients of the
CVR
ranged from 0.96 to 1.00.
The theoretical validity was verified by exploratory factor analysis with simple Oblimin
rotation and Kaiser normalization and confirmatory factor analysis. Criterion validity wasestimated on the basis of the analysis of the correlation matrix with dimensions theoreticallyrelated to social functioning: self-esteem, life satisfaction, social support and the resultsof other tests measuring social functioning. Cronbach’s
alpha
coefficients in the group of
studied women ranged from 0.81 to 0.88, and in the population of men, from 0.83 to 0.90.
The results were converted to sten scores.
2.7. Measurements of Controlled Variables
For the measurement of controlled variables, a questionnaire created for the needs of
the conducted research was used.  It consisted of a series of questions about sociodemo-graphic data (gender, age, place of residence, education status, marital status, number ofchildren, professional activity) and the health condition of the respondents.

2.8. Statistical Analysis
Statistical calculations were performed on anonymized data using IBM SPSS 27 with
AMOS software.
The description of the researched sample was based on the calculation of the percent-
age distribution of the qualitative data frequency, the mean values, standard deviation andminimum and maximum values of quantitative parameters.
The significance level of intergroup differences in terms of qualitative data was verified
using the
c
2
test.  The reliability of the tests was estimated based on the Cronbach
alpha
measures.
The shape of the variable distributions was estimated on the basis of the Kolmogorov–
Smirnov test. Levels of activity of the research subjects were compared using a
c
2
test, while
the effect size was determined based on Cramer’s
V
value. The verification of intergender
differences was carried out using Student’s
t
-test for independent data, the statistically
significant results of which were supplemented by estimating the size of the effects usingCohen’s
d
coefficient.
The characteristics of the physical activity of the respondents, their mental health,
cognitive functioning and social functioning were determined on the basis of the mean
value, standard deviation and minimum and maximum values.
The estimation of measurement models and the interactive structural model was per-
formed using SEM structural equation modeling in the confirmatory version, in which theMaximum Likelihood
method was used. The use of an advanced method of statistical analy-
sis made it possible to verify the occurrence and significance of mutual and multifacetedinteraction of individual factors forming the structure of physical activity for women andmen, shaping the state of mental health and cognitive disorders, as well as social function-ing. In the presented models (measurement and structural), the values placed next to thearrows indicate the estimates of standardized coefficients for a given path, while the valuesabove the observable variables represent the constants in the equation. The coefficients forrandom factors (variables e) are initially arbitrarily set at the level of 1 as non-standardized,and after standardization, their values are equal to 0 and are not presented.
In the work, the boundary point of committing a type I error is 0.05.

Nearly three-quarters of the women surveyed showed a sufficient level of weekly
physical activity. A high level of activity characterized 15.0% of female respondents, and a
low level of activity characterized more than one-tenth of female respondents.
In the group of men, more than three-quarters of the study participants were charac-
terized by a high level of weekly physical activity. The activity of nearly one-fifth of therespondents was sufficient, while the lowest percentage of men showed insufficient weekly
physical activity.

The analysis resulted in a strong statistically significant gender effect for weekly
physical activity.
Women, compared to men, less often revealed a high level of physical activity, while
more often, their weekly activity was classified as sufficient and insufficient.
In the second step of the analysis, the level of physical activity, mental health, cognitive
processes and the quality of social functioning of the surveyed women and men were
assessed. The results of the comparative analysis are presented in Table

The weekly physical activity of the surveyed women was classified as sufficient. How-
ever, in the male population it reached a high level. Regardless of gender, the respondentsspent the most time on walks, then on intense physical activity, and the least on training
with a moderate level of vigorous activity and passive rest (sitting, lying down).
The general mental health of the study participants was within the upper limit of the
average results, which also suggests that in the analyzed population of women, in the eventof the occurrence of adverse factors generating severe and chronic stress, there may be arisk of developing symptoms characteristic of mental health disorders. In women, somaticsymptoms were most severely intensified, followed by anxiety and insomnia, symptoms ofdepression and symptoms typical of disorders in everyday functioning. In the group ofmen, the overall mental health condition was moderate. The respondents were dominatedby a sense of anxiety and insomnia, while functional disorders, somatic symptoms andsymptoms of depression were less severe.
The functioning of the cognitive processes of the studied populations was classified as
moderate. In the female population, the most pronounced difficulties related to perceptual
work,  followed by perception deficits and attention deficits.   The highest intensity of
perception deficits was observed in men, while the problems with perceptual work and
attention deficits were at a slightly lower level.
Social functioning of the analyzed groups was in the area of moderate results. Women
did best in family relationships and among acquaintances and friends,  and the worst
96

IJERPH
2022

, 11860
in professional interactions.  Men showed the highest level of coping skills in interper-sonal relationships, then in family relationships, and the poorest quality of interactions in
professional relationships.
As a result of the comparative analysis, a strong gender effect was noted for moderate
activity; moderate gender effects for weekly activity, somatic symptoms, cognitive function-ing, perceptual work, attention deficits and professional relationships; and weak gendereffects for walking, vigorous activity, mental disorders, functional disorders, depressivesymptoms and family relationships.
Compared to men, women showed a lower level of weekly physical activity, walking,
moderate physical activity and vigorous physical activity, as well as a lower quality offamily relationships. Moreover, more severe mental disorders, somatic symptoms, func-tional disorders, depressive symptoms, cognitive disorders, perceptual work disorders,attention deficits and a higher quality of relationships in the area of professional life weremore often noted in the female population than in men.  On the other hand, sitting andlying down, anxiety and insomnia, perception deficits, social relationship and interpersonalrelationships were at a comparable level in the analyzed groups.3.2. Estimation of Measurement Models
Prior to estimation of the complete interactive structural model presenting the relation-
ships between physical activity, mental health, cognitive disorders and social functioning,its four measurement parts were estimated. Model specifications were carried out in thegroup of women and men.
In the first measurement model, physical activity is a latent variable, while its partial
indicators are walking, moderate
activity and vigorous activity. Figure
1
shows the results of
verification of the constructed model of physical activity measurement in the group of women,
and Figure
2
illustrates the measurement model of physical activity in the group of men.
As a result of the estimation, the following measures were obtained: CMIN/DF = 1.75;
GFI = 0.99; AGFI = 0.99; NFI = 0.99; RFI = 0.95; IFI = 0.99; TLI = 0.99; CFI = 0.99; RM-SEA = 0.001(0.001; 0.05); PCLOSE = 0.92;
N
HOELTER(1269; 1561), which confirm that the
model reflects the nature of the relationships between the analyzed variablesvery well. Thestandardized values of factor loadings and the percentages of variances explained in eachof the analyzed groups show that the constructed model of physical activity measurementis acceptable.Figure 1.

In the second measurement model, the presence of mental health disorders is an unob-
servable variable, and its partial indicators are somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia,functional disorders and the symptoms of depression.  The results of the verification ofthe constructed model for measuring mental health disorders in the group of women areshown in Figures

The following measures were obtained during the verification of the model: CMIN/DF
= 1.75; GFI = 0.99; AGFI = 0.99; NFI = 0.99; RFI = 0.95; IFI = 0.99; TLI = 0.99; CFI = 0.99;RMSEA = 0.001(0.001; 0.05); PCLOSE = 0.92;
N
HOELTER(1116; 1442), which confirm that
it is correctly fitted to the data, and the standardized values of factor loadings and the
percentages of variances explained in the group of women and men allow for recognizing
the constructed model of mental health disorders measurement as acceptable.
In the third measurement model, the presence of cognitive disorders is an unobservable
variable, and its partial indicators are perceptual work, perception deficits and attention
deficits. The results of the verification of the constructed model for measuring cognitivedisorders in the group of women are shown in Figures
5
and

The estimation and acceptance of the constructed measurement models allows for the
estimation of the full interactive structural model, which was developed on the basis ofthe theoretical frameworks. As in the case of measurement models, its specification wascarried out in the group of women and men. Figure

shows the construction and detailed
standardized parameters of the interactive model of the relationship between physicalactivity, mental health, cognitive disorders and social functioning in the group of women,and Figure
10
depicts the results obtained in the group of men.
The accuracy of the interactive structural model was positively verified based on
the following measures of goodness of fit:  CMIN/DF = 1.38; GFI = 0.99; AGFI = 0.97;
NFI = 0.98;
RFI = 0.96;  IFI = 0.99;  TLI = 0.99;  CFI = 0.99;  RMSEA = 0.019 (0.008;  0.28);
PCLOSE = 1.00;
N
HOELTER(1008; 1120).
In the group of women, the constructed model explained 51.0% of social functioning,
which reflects the quality of tolerable family, interpersonal and professional relationships,
and in the population of men, 41.0% of the variance of the analyzed variable was explained.

The model shows that the consequences of the COVID-19 epidemic in Eastern Poland
expressed in the form of mental health disorders and symptoms typical of cognitive dis-orders were moderated by physical activity from various sources.  The more often therespondents engaged in physical activity by going for walks and training moderatelyand vigorously, the lower the risk was of developing mental disorders, manifested in theform of somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, functional disorders and the symp-toms of depression, as well as the occurrence of cognitive disorders, such as perceptual
work disorders,  perception deficits and attention deficits.   Moreover,  physical activityweakened the relationship between mental health disorders and disorders of cognitive
processes and social functioning in family, interpersonal and professional relationships of
the studied groups.
It should also be added that the comparisons of the values of parameters within
and between groups showed that the relationship between mental health disorders andcognitive disorders was comparable in each group and stronger than the correlations
102

between physical activity and mental health disorders and cognitive disorders. Moreover,in the case of women, the leading factor associated with the quality of social interactions
was the state of mental health, which was less dependent on the level of physical activity
than on the functioning of cognitive processes moderated by physical effort, while the
quality of male social interactions depended on the relationship between the state of mental
health and the cognitive functioning that is impaired by physical activity. In the population
of women, compared to men, physical activity was less important for mental health andthe functioning of cognitive processes, and the occurrence of symptoms typical of mentalhealth disorders was more strongly associated with the quality of social interactions of
women than men. It has also been shown that disorders of cognitive processes correlate
more weakly with the social functioning of women than men.4. Discussion
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic caused severe and long-lasting stress in
many people from different countries of the world, the relatively common consequences of
which were mental health problems associated with deterioration of cognitive and social
functioning [
6
,
53
,
54
]. Despite many published empirical studies devoted to the discussed
issue, the role of physical activity in the prevention of psychosocial functioning of theinhabitants of Eastern Poland has not been analyzed so far [
53
,
55
,
56
].
Therefore, research was carried out to assess the level of physical activity, mental health,
cognitive processes and social functioning, as well as the interactions and relationshipsbetween them, in the population of Eastern Poland, depending on gender.
With regard to the above goals, two hypotheses were formulated. The first of them
assumed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, in the inhabitants of Eastern Poland, thelevel of physical activity and the severity of symptoms characteristic of mental healthdisorders, cognitive disorders and the quality of social functioning differed depending
on gender.
The conducted analysis allowed us to positively verify the adopted assumption in
terms of statistically significant gender differences regarding levels and severity of weeklyactivity, as well as the severity of vigorous activity, moderate activity, walking, mental dis-orders, somatic symptoms, functional disorders, depressive symptoms, cognitive disorders,
perceptual work, attention deficits, family relationships and professional relationships. It
has been shown that women were less likely than men to show a high level of physicalactivity, but more often their weekly activity ranked at sufficient and insufficient levels. It
was also noted that surveyed men showed higher than average physical activity, walking,
moderate physical activity and vigorous physical activity than women, and they functionedmore efficiently in family relationships, but had more difficulty finding their way in profes-sional interactions. Moreover, men showed a lower severity of mental disorders, somaticsymptoms, functional disorders, depressive symptoms, cognitive disorders, perceptual
work disorders and attention deficits as compared to women.
The men had a moderate state of mental health and cognitive processes, while women’s
scores in mental disorders and perceptual work disorders were approaching the edge of the
elevated area. The average weekly physical activity of men was high, and that of women
was at a sufficient level, with the activity of more than three-quarters of the men surveyed
being high, at nearly one-fifth sufficient, and 5.8% insufficient. In contrast, the women’sgroup reported markedly different results. Almost three-fourths of the female respondentsshowed a sufficient level of activity, while high and low activity levels were reported by
15.0% and 13.7% of the respondents, respectively.
Comparing the data obtained with the results of surveys conducted in other regions
of Poland and the world,  one can see significant discrepancies.   The research alreadymentioned in the theoretical introduction proves that both men and women from thenortheastern part of Poland manifest an insufficient and significantly understated level of
physical activity in comparison to residents of other regions of this country and European
103

IJERPH
2022
,
19
, 11860
countries. At the same time, men engaged in moderate physical activity and rode a bicyclemore frequently than women [
33
].
Another empirical study also observed that women reported lower moderate physical
activity than men, but were more likely to engage in light physical activity.  It is worthnoting, however, that because the study was conducted in a population of patients with adiagnosis of peripheral artery disease, vigorous activity was not analyzed in the study [
57
].
In contrast, a Canadian study, similar to our own, reported that women were less
physically active than men during the COVID-19 pandemic, a result that was statistically
significant [
58
]. Analogous observations have also come from the general population of
Beirut [
59
]. In addition, women reported more barriers to engaging in systematic physical
activity and reported significantly weaker mental fitness than the opposite sex [
58
,
59
]. A
key observation appears to be that, among women, the most severe adverse mental healthsymptoms occurred in subjects whose physical activity was very low [
58
].
Thus, both the results of our own study and the conclusions of the work of other
researchers suggest that, especially in the group of women, in the event of the occurrenceor intensification of the impact of existing stressors, there may be a risk of developingundesirable symptoms in the state of mental health and cognitive processes [
60
].  This
observation seems to be particularly important in the situation of a prolonged health crisis,because the effectiveness of coping, under the influence of chronic distress, may show adownward trend, and this directly implies an increased risk of undesirable symptoms inthe field of mental health [
61
].
This effect was observed by Di Maio’s team. On the basis of the conducted moderation
analysis, he noted that the belief in the possessed remedial abilities was directly related to
physical activity in a situation where the encountered challenges were relatively low. On
the other hand, when these challenges were high, the relationship between physical effortand faith in one’s abilities did not reach the level of statistical significance. The observeddependencies confirm the need to monitor not only direct but also long-term consequencesin terms of the mental health of people affected by the COVID-19 pandemic [
62
].
The need to conduct this type of longitudinal research is also indicated by other
researchers who, while forecasting the upcoming increase in the number of patients withdepressive and anxiety disorders resulting from the current health crisis, as well as from thecurrent problems of the mental health care system, point to the important role of physicalactivity in preventive interventions [
7
,
63
].  Systematic endurance training, by activating
the HPA axis, stimulates the release of dopamine, which is responsible for self-regulationand mood [
64
,
65
].  The results of the meta-analysis, which included the data of 40,550
adults, show that the respondents who undertook systematic physical activity, comparedto women and men with moderate and low activity, were less likely to develop mentaldisorders. The highest risk group was those who led a sedentary lifestyle [
66
], while the
level of physical activity, physical fitness, mental health, cognitive processes and the qualityof functioning in social interactions were higher in men than in women [
67
–
70
].
In this context, it should be noted, however, that the relationships between the afore-
mentioned variables in the interactive and multidimensional approach have not beenanalyzed so far [
71
,
72
].  Taking into account the above premises, the second hypothesis
assumed that during the COVID-19 pandemic in the inhabitants of Eastern Poland, de-
pending on gender, the following are different:  the importance of interactions between
physical activity, mental health and cognitive disorders for social functioning.
The constructed structural model of the relationship between physical activity and
selected aspects  of  psychosocial  functioning  allowed  for  a  positive  verification  of  the
assumption. As a result of its estimation, in the group of women and men, the existence ofinteractions between physical activity, disorders of mental health and cognitive processes
was confirmed, and their association with the social functioning of the analyzed groupswas verified.  Systematic physical activity, including intense and moderate endurance
training and walking, was negatively associated with symptoms characteristic of mentalhealth disorders, which include symptoms of depression, functional disorders, anxiety
104

IJERPH
2022
,
19
, 11860
and insomnia and somatization, as well as cognitive disorders manifesting as weakenedspeed of perception and deficits in perceptiveness and attention to social functioning ofthe respondents.
In the case of women, the leading factor related to the quality of social interactions was
the state of mental health, which was less dependent on the level of physical activity thanon the functioning of cognitive processes, while the quality of men’s social interactions wasmost dependent on the relationship between the state of mental health and the functioningof cognitive processes.  Moreover, in the group of women, compared to men, physicalactivity was more weakly linked to the state of mental health and the functioning ofcognitive processes, and the occurrence of symptoms typical of mental health disordershad correlated more strongly with the quality of women’s social interactions than men’s.In turn, cognitive disorders were more weakly linked to the social functioning of womenthan men.
Relating the observed regularities to the conclusions of the empirical works of other
researchers, it can be seen that they are to some extent similar [
67
,
73
]. In a sample of 5856
adults aged 26–70 years, it was noted that in the male population, physical activity wasmore negatively associated with problems in the sphere of mental functioning than in thegroup of women [
67
].
Another empirical study positively verified and moderated the role of gender in
relation to physical activity, health-related quality of life and perceived social support. It
was shown that people with the lowest assessments of mental health status had a 1.8 times
lower probability of obtaining social support than respondents who showed high andaverage assessments of mental condition, while the participants with the lowest results interms of physical health were twice as likely to be deprived of the help of their relatives than
women and men who perceived their somatic health as very good or average. Moreover,
men with low physical activity compared to women more often reported poor mental andsomatic health and a lower overall quality of life than women. It should be added, however,that the discussed model did not take into account the symptoms characteristic of cognitivedisorders [
73
].
Summing up the discussion,  it is worth emphasizing that the results of our own
research seem promising in the context of preventing the psychosocial functioning ofadult inhabitants of Eastern Poland who have been affected by the COVID-19 epidemic.
Nevertheless, due to the existing limitations, the observed effects require further empirical
verification.
The aforementioned limitations include the fact that, in order to minimize the risk
of SARS-CoV-2 infection and taking into account the epidemic restrictions in the country,the study was conducted online, which might not have been fully comfortable for the
participants. In addition, the study sample consisted of volunteers, who had access and
the ability to use a computer, which, despite a relatively large number of observations andcontrolling for a number of side variables, could have affected the results. Consequently,the data may not fully reflect the psychosocial situation in the Eastern region of Poland. Inaddition, the study population was made up exclusively of people who were employedand those in marriages and partnerships. This suggests, therefore, that the research resultsobtained should be generalized, with some caution, only to the population of healthy,economically active residents of Eastern Poland with life partners.
It should also be added that there were no people infected with the SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus and COVID-19 patients among the participants, so in the subsequent studies,it would be worth verifying whether this factor differentiates mental health disorders,cognitive disorders and social functioning.   Another area requiring exploration is thedetermination of the level of physical activity and these parameters and the relationshipsbetween them in the population of medical staff, especially those who specialize in COVID-
19 treatment. Due to the specificity of their work, the indicators of physical activity, mental
health and cognitive problems as well as social functioning may be higher in this groupthan in the general population. It is also important to mention that the region of Eastern
105

IJERPH
2022
,
19
, 11860
Poland is characterized by a relatively low transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus;therefore, the psychosocial consequences of the epidemic may be lower in the inhabitantsof this part of the country than in those affected by a higher epidemic risk.
Another aspect that should be mentioned in the context of discussing the limitations
of the presented results is that due to the cross-sectional nature of the research and the lackof data from before the outbreak of the pandemic, the conducted analysis showed only thecurrent intensity of individual parameters and the strength of the relationships betweenthem; however, the dynamics of changes under the influence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission
were not estimated. For this reason, it is not possible to precisely determine to what extent
the current pandemic situation has influenced the change in the intensity of the analyzed
variables and the strength of their relationships.
It is also worth mentioning that the measurement of physical activity was carried out
using the short form of the questionnaire (
IPAQ-SF
), which may have made it slightly less
reliable than the full version (
IPAQ
)[
25
,
50
]. However, the decision to choose the
IPAQ-SF
was based on the suggestions of the authors of the Polish adaptation of the test, who,
based on the conclusions of a number of empirical studies, recommend the use of theabbreviated Polish version of the tool for research conducted both within one countryand conducted internationally. They point out that the full version of the
IPAQ
—due to
its detail—requires much greater involvement of the subjects, and this in turn directly
implies impatience, a tendency to give random answers, skip questions or drop out of thesurvey [
50
].  Researchers from other regions of the world have also encountered similar
problems with the full version of the test [
25
]. Given that in our study, in addition to the test
used to measure physical activity, four other questionnaires were used, the aforementioned
risks were reduced by using the
IPAQ-SF
[
25
–
50
].
Nevertheless, the presented study is the first and largest project focused on the analysis
of the psychosocial functioning of the inhabitants of Eastern Poland during the COVID-19epidemic, in which diagnostic tools with high psychometric properties and advanced statis-tical methods were used. This allowed for the visualization of the structure of mutual andmultifaceted relationships between particular variables in the group of women and men.
Moreover, the discoveries are of great cognitive and practical importance. Determining
the current level of psychosocial functioning of the inhabitants of Eastern Poland duringthe pandemic, in terms of the level of physical activity, mental health, cognitive processesand the quality of social functioning, as well as verifying the occurrence and significance ofinteractions and relationships depending on gender, not only enriches knowledge aboutthe mechanisms shaping the responses of adults to the current health crisis, but it is aboveall the basic element that allows for taking effective preventive actions.  Confirmationthat various forms of physical activity are a factor protecting against negative effects onmental health,  cognitive processes and social functioning may constitute the basis fordeveloping gender-individualized, interdisciplinary psychopreventive interventions aimedat strengthening the intrapsychic and interpersonal spheres of women and men at risk ofthe negative consequences of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.5. Conclusions
The conducted analyses allowed us to determine the current level of psychosocial
functioning of the inhabitants of Eastern Poland, as well as the interactions and relationshipsbetween physical activity, disorders of mental health and cognitive processes and socialfunctioning during the COVID-19 epidemic, which in turn allowed for the formulation ofthe following implicative conclusions:
•
Taking into account that the population in question included people at risk of devel-oping problems in psychosocial functioning, it would be important to support theanalyzed population with an appropriate preventive program;
•
Women, as compared to men, show a lower level of physical activity, including weeklyactivity,  walking,  moderate activity and vigorous activity,  which may be a resultof different uses of time in the course of a day, and for women, is associated with
106

IJERPH
2022
,
19
, 11860
higher recorded intensity of symptoms common to mental health disorders, especiallysomatic symptoms, functional disorders and depressive symptoms, as well as cognitivedisorders—in particular those related to perceptual work and attention deficits, andalso lower quality of functioning in family relationships, although higher coping skillsin professional interactions are also seen; as a result, the developed program in thecase of women should include interventions to support effective time management,and it is necessary that it be adjusted to the specifics of individual differences notedbetween women and men;
•
Whereas physical activity, interacting with mental health disorders and cognitivedisorders, weakens their coexistence and the relationship with social functioning, it isimportant to indicate that systematic exercise training adapted to the state of healthand abilities of the organism may be an important element of psychoprophylaxis
programs;
•
Taking into account that in the male population, the negative associations of physicalactivity with symptoms typical of mental health and cognitive disorders are strongerthan in the female population, while women’s social functioning depends more ontheir mental health than on their cognitive deficits, and the quality of men’s familyrelationships and interpersonal and professional relationships is similarly linked tomental health and cognitive disorders, the developed preventive interventions shouldbe implemented early and tailored to the individual needs of the participants, whichmay translate into an amplification of their benefits.
In conclusion, it appears to be important to develop a systematic and interdisciplinary
psychoprophylactic physical training program individualized based on gender and health
condition. Designing this type of intervention would provide an opportunity to improvethe intrapsychic, cognitive and social functioning of Eastern Poland’s population duringthe COVID-19 epidemic.

Abstract:
Background:  Kickboxing is a combat sport that is complex in technique,  tactics,  and
movement structure, and requires an adequate level of motor skills as a foundation for activities
during competitions. General physical fitness, defined as the effect of the externalization of motorskills, is the basis for athletic training regardless of the sport. The aim of this study was to determinethe effect of modified training based on the principles of CrossFit on the development of general
physical fitness in a group of kickboxers compared to a control group.  Methods:  The study was
experimental in nature and was conducted in a group of 60 kickboxers, divided into experimentaland control groups. Participants were selected by purposive sampling, and the criteria were trainingexperience, sports skill level (minimum class 1 athletes), and consent to participate in the experiment.
The intervention in the study group involved the introduction of CrossFit-based training into a
conventional kickboxing training program. General and special physical fitness of the athletes werediagnosed.  Results:  Statistically significant differences were found in general fitness in terms ofabdominal strength (
p
< 0.001), pull-ups (
p
< 0.001), dynamometric measurement of handgrip force
(
p
< 0.001) (kg), clap push-ups (
p
< 0.001), standing long jump (
p
< 0.001), shuttle run
(
p
< 0.001),
sit-and-reach (
p
< 0.001), and tapping (
p
< 0.001).  Furthermore, changes in special fitness were
also demonstrated for the special kickboxing fitness test (SKFT) (
p
< 0.02),  the total number of
punches (
p
< 0.001), punching speed (
p
< 0.001), and hip turning speed (
p
< 0.001). There was also a
correlation between characteristics of general fitness and special fitness (
p
< 0.001). Conclusions: The
experimental training program based on the principles of CrossFit training had a positive effect onthe general and special kickboxing physical fitness.Keywords:

1. Introduction
General physical fitness, defined as the effect of the externalization of motor skills, is
the basis for athletic training regardless of the sport [
1
–
3
]. By properly developing its level,
it is possible to implement more precise and effective specialized training forms, which area prerequisite for athletes’ performance during tournaments [
4
–
6
]. Research also shows
that inadequate levels of fitness may increase the likelihood of injury [
7
]. The development
of the athlete’s motor skills depends on sport [
1
].  Kickboxing is a combat sport that is
complex in technique, tactics, and movement structure, and requires an adequate level ofmotor skills as a foundation for activities during competitions [
8
–
10
].
Research on the effectiveness of combat sports training indicates that it is highly
dependent on general motor skills [
11
–
14
]. For kickboxers, the basis for high competitive

performance is a high level of strength, dynamics, anaerobic capacity, and aerobic capacity,
with the latter considered the necessary foundation for all activities. Therefore, physical
preparation should be based on improving upper limb strength and speed (punches and
combinations during offensive actions and blocks and dodges during defensive actions)and developing high levels of anaerobic power (dynamic kicks and punches) [
15
,
16
].
Training efficiency, which is the ability to endure loads based on sufficient physi-
cal capacity, is also an important element that increases the competitive performance of
athletes [
17
–
20
].
The specifics of training at the elite level should be tailored to the individ-
ual athlete’s needs. In search of opportunities to improve work efficiency during training,modern forms of training are implemented and verified, often differing from the classictraining methods commonly used in kickboxing, which include repetition methods (at max-imal or submaximal work intensity, full rests) and interval methods (low, medium, or highintensity, and incomplete rests) based on technical elements using special coaching devicessuch as focus mitts, kick shields, punching bags, etc. [
5
,
21
].
The growing popularity of CrossFit is of interest to researchers in the context of imple-
menting this training modality, with its hallmark being competing during exercise [
22
,
23
].
This type of training, based on exercises derived from the arsenal of training means used in
gymnastics, weightlifting, and strength and functional training, is focused on the continu-ous improvement of the athlete’s performance in individual exercises through competition
with a training partner or themself [
24
]. This model of strength and conditioning training
can also be applied in the kickboxing environment.
The implementation of new forms of training and the detailed verification of their
effects on the physical capabilities of athletes are widespread in combat sports [
25
–
29
].
Through the implementation of experimental training plans, it becomes possible to improve
the quality of training, which can, in turn, affect the competitive performance of athletes [
30
].
The implementation of modern experimental forms of training in kickboxing is popular,
and the novelty of our study is the introduction of the author’s form of training based onCrossFit training with exercises commonly used in kickboxing. Contemporary analyses inthe context of the implementation of CrossFit training in the structure of kickboxing includethe effect of CrossFit exercises on the body posture of kickboxers [
31
], and a comparison
of CrossFit training and other forms of resistance training to maintain an optimal levelof fitness [
32
].
To determine the athlete’s level of preparation for the competition, an analysis of a fight
is performed [
16
,
33
,
34
] by determining the technical and tactical indices or by evaluating
special physical fitness using tests corresponding to the structure of a kickboxing bout [
35
].
This type of analysis was conducted in the present study.
The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the author ’s training according to
the principles of CrossFit on the development of general and special physical fitness in agroup of kickboxers compared to a control group. The choice of general fitness tests wasbased on examinations performed in previous studies [
16
,
33
].  In this study, an attempt
was made to find if the proposed experimental training program could be successfully
implemented into the regular strength and conditioning programs in kickboxing.2. Material and Methods2.1. Study Group
The study was experimental in nature and was conducted in a group of 60 male
kickboxers.  Based on the sample size, as determined using G*Power software 3.1.9.4, it
was shown that, with the estimated moderate effect size, at least twenty participants were
needed in each group (effect siz
e f = 0.65, power = 0.95,
p
= 0.05) [

].  In the present
analysis, 30 participants in each group were recruited to ensure a more accurate analysis.Participants were selected by purposive sampling, i.e., subjective non-random samplingbased on clear criteria for selecting a group for the study such as training experience,sports skill level (minimum class 1 athletes; in Poland, athletes are classified by sportsskill classes:  there are classes 1, 2, and 3, with each class determined based on winning

during competitions), consent to participate in the experiment, and good health status. Theinclusion criteria adopted were due to the high intensity of the proposed form of trainingthat requires the participants to have bodies adapted to such a high level of exercise. Theselected group was randomly divided into two (experimental and control) groups, eachconsisting of 30 athletes.
In the control group, training was conducted according to a standard general cycle.
In the study group (experimental), training was modified (independent variable) by in-
troducing an experimental program (CrossFit workout) into their standard training. Theexperiment required a high degree of accuracy and maximum commitment from the ath-letes. During the experiment, the athletes did not participate in sporting events or sparringat competitive intensity levels and did not report any injuries. Observation of the changesin the experiment and their quantitative evaluation were also performed. The dependent
variable in this case was general and special physical fitness, viewed as differences in the
fitness test results in both groups.2.2. Morphological Characteristics of the Subjects
The mean training experience in all participants was 8.1
±
4.24 years. They trained
1.5 to 2 h,
6 to 8 times per week. The mean age of study participants was
20.07

1.46 years,
body weight was 73.56
±
8.13 kg, body height was 179.55
±
0.45 cm, body fat was
14
±
0.2%,
and BMI was 23.63
±

.  Body composition and body weight were measured
using a Tanita BC-601 body composition monitor (Tanita, Tokyo, Japan) [
37
] in the morning
in fasting conditions, whereas body height was measured using a SECA 2017 body heightmeter (Seca, Hamburg, Deutschland).  The examination was performed in the standing
position, as recommended by the manufacturer. The subjects did not consume alcohol the
day before the measurement and avoided large meals and extreme physical exercise.2.3. Research Program and Methodology
According to the principles of the implementation of pedagogical experiments, the
researcher ’s interference involved manipulation of the training process in the experimentalgroup. The first examination took place before the experimental training in both groups,in the control and preparation mesocycle of the preparation period.  Next, the group of
participants performed a modified workout (by introducing an experimental program
based on CrossFit workout into their standard training programs) three times a weekduring each training session.  During this time, the control group performed standardkickboxing training without modification.  After eight weeks, another examination wasconducted (effect control).
Furthermore, each participant was instructed not to use specialized diets and supple-
mentation during the experiment due to the strong relationship between diets and resultsobtained during tests.  Diets were monitored using notebooks in which the participantsrecorded the foods they consumed using home measures based on a photo album of foodsand products.  The recording procedure was continued for 3 days:  2 working days and
1 day
off [
38
]. The analysis of diet observations revealed neither specific diets nor the use of
performance-enhancing supplements in the training groups. The experiment was approved
(No./309/KBL/OIL/2019) by the Bioethics Committee of the Regional Medical Chamber
in Krak
ó
w, Poland.
2.4. Principles of the Experimental Training
Using the principles of CrossFit training methodology [
39
] and typical kickboxing
training exercises based on the most frequently performed techniques [
40
],  a training
program was developed to improve the physical fitness of kickboxers (Table
1
).

AMRAP—As many rounds as possible, a method of training that involves performing as many sets of efforts as
possible at a fixed number of repetitions in a given time.
The experimental training program is based on the AMRAP method (Table
2
), which
consists of performing as many sets of efforts as possible with a fixed number of repetitionsin a given time (10 min in this case) [
39
]. To avoid boredom and training routine, a different
training unit was planned for each workout of the week. Each workout was preceded bya warm-up and consisted of 8 exercises including boxing punches, kickboxing kicks, andexercises typical of the CrossFit methodology such as burpees (transition from standingupright to squat position, kicking the feet back to a front support position, returning tosquat position, and jumping up), or box jumps.  The training program was designed sothat it was simple to perform and accessible to every participant.  Therefore, additionalequipment was kept to a minimum.

2.5. Physical Fitness Tests
Physical fitness was evaluated using selected items of the International Committee on
the Standardization of Physical Fitness Test (ICSPFT) [
2
] and Eurofit Physical Fitness Test
(EUROFIT) [
41
]. The entire test battery consisted of the following tests:
1.
Cooper test (in m). A running endurance test consisting of 12 min of uninterruptedrunning. The running distance is measured [
42
].
2.
Dynamic sit-ups (in reps). Evaluation of abdominal strength: the tested person lieson the mattress with feet 30 cm apart and knees bent at a right angle.  Hands areintertwined, resting on the neck. The participant is assisted by a partner who holdsthe participant’s feet so that they remain in contact with the ground.  At the startsignal, the participant sits up to touch the knees with elbows and then returns to thestarting position. The exercise duration is 30 s [
41
].
3.
Pull-ups (in reps). Evaluation of the strength of the shoulder girdle using the numberof repetitions: the participant catches the bar with a pronated grip and hangs; at thesignal, the participant bends their arms at the elbows and pulls the body up so highthat the chin is above the bar and then, without a rest, returns to a simple hanging; the
114

IJERPH
2022
,
19
, 4526
exercise is repeated as many times as possible without a rest; the result is the numberof complete pull-ups (chin over the bar) [
2
].
4.
Measuring handgrip strength with a dynamometer (evaluation of static force). The
participant stands with a small straddle with a dynamometer held tightly in the
fingers.  The arm is positioned along the body so that the hand does not touch the
body, and the participant performs a short grip on the dynamometer with maximumforce, with the other arm resting along the body. The better result of the two tests ofmaximal static strength (in kgf) of the dominant hand (HGSmax) using a handgripdynamometer (MG 4800, Charder, Taichung, Taiwan) was recorded, with an accuracyof 1 kg. The better score of the right and left hand tests was recorded, and the intervalbetween the tests was 5 min [
41
].
5.
Flexibility test: sit-and-reach (in cm). The test is performed as a sit-and-reach move-ment, with the range of motion measured in cm, below the feet level.  In a seated
position, the participant reaches their arms forward as far as they can. The participant,
in a straddle sitting position, reaches forward with the hands as far as possible bysliding the ruler on the surface of the box with a previously prepared scale.  Thebetter of the two results is recorded.  If the participant reaches 10 cm beyond thetoes, they achieve a score of 10.  A box 40 cm long, 45 cm wide, and 35 cm high, a65 cm long graduated box top protrudes 25 cm over the side wall that marks the
width of the box and is used as a feet rest; the box top is fixed in such a way that the
graduation mark drawn on it indicates 50 in the place where feet touch the surfaceof the box. A 30 cm-long ruler is placed loosely on the surface of the box perpendic-ularly to its longitudinal axis and used for moving with hands while performing aforward reach [
41
].
6.
Shuttle run (in s). The participant runs on a signal to the second line 5 m away, crossesit with both feet, and comes back. They run 10 times for a distance of 5 m; the time ofthe shuttle run is measured and rounded to a decimal place of a second [
41
].
7.
Tapping (assessment of the speed of upper limb movement). The participant stands
with a small straddle, putting the non-dominant hand on a rectangular plate; the
dominant  hand  should  be  placed  crosswise  on  the  opposite  plate,  and  then  the
participant touches both plates alternately as quickly as possible.  The participant
performs a total of 50 movements, i.e., touches each plate 25 times. The better of the
two results is recorded, determined by the time it takes to touch each plate 25 times,
measured to the nearest 0.1 s. The equipment needed includes an adjustable heighttable (or vaulting box), two rubber discs 20 cm in diameter horizontally attached tothe table with their centers 80 cm apart, a 10
×
20 cm rectangular plate placed in the
middle between them, and a timer [
41
].
8.
Clap push-ups (n)—in the front support position with feet on a gym bench (30 cm),the participant performs the maximum number of push-ups from the ground with ahand clap [
43
].
9.
Standing long jump (in cm). The participant stands with the feet slightly apart in frontof the starting line, bends the knees, and moves the arms backward at the same time,and then they perform an arm swing and jump as far as they can; the landing occurson both feet while maintaining the upright position; the test is performed twice. Thelongest of the two jumps measured to the closest mark left by the participant’s heel isrecorded, with an accuracy of 1 cm [
41
].
10.
To assess special fitness, the special kickboxing fitness test (SKFT) [
35
] and batteries of
special fitness tests designed for combat sports in the standing position were used [
44
].
11.
To evaluate special fitness levels and technical skills, all participants underwent thespecial kickboxing fitness test (SKFT) [
45
]. Description of the procedure for special
kickboxing physical fitness test: Prior to performing the test, participants performeda warm-up that included 5 min of an easy run and 10 min of general warm-up andstretching (flexibility) exercises.  The following tools were prepared to perform thetest: adhesive tape to mark distances on the mat, a stopwatch to measure time, kick
115

IJERPH
2022
,
19
, 4526
shields and punch shields, a protocol for recording the results, and a sport tester
(heart rate monitor). In the first station, the athlete performs, from a fighting stance,
a combination of punches to the shield held by the partner:  left and right straight
punches to the head, without stopping, for 30 s. After completing this part of the test,
the athlete runs 10 m in a straight line to the next station (No.  2), where, from thefighting position, they perform roundhouse kicks to the shield held by the partner for30 s: left high kick (high roundhouse kick) and right high kick to the head. Next, theathlete runs back to the first station with shields and performs a left straight-right hookcombination for another 30 s to the head. After completion of this part of the test, theathlete runs 10 m to the partner holding the shield in station 2 and performs middleroundhouse kicks for 30 s alternately with the right and left leg to the body trunk.
The total special exercise time during the test is 2 min (4
×
30 s). Correctly performed
kicks and punches were counted in each of the four parts. Heart rate (HR, bpm) wasmeasured directly after completion of the test and after 1 min rest. The Garmin HRMchest strap was used in the tests.  The proposed special fitness test allowed for theevaluation of the technical level of athletes in terms of the most effective and mostfrequently used hand techniques (punches) and leg techniques (kicks), speed (numberof punches and kicks performed per time unit), special endurance (response of thecirculatory system and number of punches and kicks), coordination (combinationof kicks and punches), and flexibility (kicking range).  The 10 m running distanceused to move between stations corresponds to the diagonal of the largest ring foundin ring combat sports.  The technical skills used in the test ensure the selectivity ofthe test, making it inaccessible to those who do not perform special training and donot have the appropriate level of technical proficiency.  Furthermore, after the test,based on the results obtained, the index of special fitness was calculated using aspecialized formula:
Final HR
(
bpm
)
+
HR1min
(
bpm
)
Kick
+
Punches
(
N
)
where:
Final HR—heart rate recorded immediately after completion of the test;HR1 min—heart rate recorded 1 min after completion of the test;Kicks—the number of kicks performed in the test;Punches—the number of punches performed in the test.
The special fitness index reflects the level of a fighter ’s special fitness, which means theeffective interaction of the body’s exercise capacity, general fitness, and the athlete’stechnical skills. The interpretation of the score is inversely proportional: the higherthe level of special fitness, the lower the value of the kickboxing test index.
12.
Speed punches test. The punches are performed from a fighting stance. Each partici-
pant performs a combination composed of two punches: a left straight punch (Jab)
to the head and a right straight punch (Punch) to the body trunk without changingthe distance.  The shields to which the participant performs 30 such combinations
(60 punches
in total) are held by a partner at the constant height. The time needed to
perform 30 complete combinations is recorded in seconds to the nearest 0.1 s.
13.
Hip-turning speed test: in the hip-turning speed (frequency) test, each athlete has abelt attached over the right hip (unless they fight in the opposite position) and, usingthe fighting stance, turns their hips to the left. This movement causes tension of thebelt held by the coach standing behind the athlete (control).  Next, the participantreturns the hip. The participant is instructed to perform 30 hip turns (the number ofbelt tension instances is counted). The time taken to perform 30 turns was recorded.
The tests were conducted in a three-day mode at noon:  trials 1–5 on the first day,
trials 6–9
on the second day, and special fitness tests on the third. All tests were performed
before and after the experiment, except for tapping, standing long jump, and flexibility tests,
116

IJERPH

, 4526
which were performed twice, and the better score was recorded.  The intervals between
the tests were designed so that the participants rested completely. A 20 min warm-up wasconducted with the athletes prior to testing.2.6. Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis of logarithmic data was performed using STATISTICA v13.1 PL
software (Statsoft, Krak
ó
w, Poland). Basic descriptive statistics were computed: arithmetic
means, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals. The data were tested for normaldistribution using the Shapiro–Wilk test, and Student’s
t
-test for dependent variables was
used to assess the significance of differences.  Student’s
t
-test for independent variables
was used to determine the significance of differences between the control and experimental
groups. The effect size was calculated using Cohen’s d index. When d ranges from
0 to 0.2,
the effect is small, i.e., negligible; it is medium from 0.2 to 0.5, large from 0.5 to 0.8, andextremely large when over 1.4.  The relationships between the data were verified usingPearson linear correlation.  Correlation values were interpreted as weak for the rangesof
−
0.5 to 0.0 or 0.0 to 0.5, and strong for
−
1.0 to
−
0.5 or 0.5 to 1.0 [
46
,
47
].  The level of
statistically significant differences was set at
p
< 0.05.
3. Results
Statistically significant differences were found in the results of measurements before
and after the experiment in the experimental group. Significant improvements in perfor-mance were noted in all tests except for the Cooper test. The analysis of the results (Table
3
)
indicated a statistically significant increase in abdominal muscle strength (5% difference),handgrip strength, an increase in the number of pull-ups (12% difference), an increase inthe number of clap push-ups (9% increase), and an increase in the length of the long jump
(1.8% difference), as well as a decrease in the time of the shuttle run (3% difference) and
an increase in the results of the sit-and-reach test (8% difference) compared to the resultsof the initial test (pre-test compared to post-test).  No statistically significant differencesin the results of the Cooper test were observed (
p
> 0.05).  In the control group, the only
significantly improved result was the static strength test (handgrip test on a dynamometer).
A comparison of the difference between the groups after the experiment revealed statis-
tically significant differences in abdominal strength, clap push-ups, standing long jump,
sit-and-reach, and tapping (Table
3
).
The analysis of the changes in special fitness induced by the experiment showed a
significant improvement in all the parameters measured in the experimental group. Fur-thermore, there were significant adverse changes in the control group in punch speed andhip-turning speed. The difference between the groups after completion of the experimenton the special kickboxing fitness test (SKFT) and the total number of punches in the testand the hip-turning speed were also found to be statistically significant (Table
4
).
There were statistically significant relationships of endurance as measured by the
Cooper test, total number of punches in the SKFT, speed of upper limb movements (tapping)
with punching speed, and agility run with hip-turning speed.  All the correlations were
high and statistically significant at
p
< 0.001 (Table
5
).

Statistically significant values are bolded.4. Discussion
In this study, we attempted to determine the effect of CrossFit training on the general
and special physical fitness of kickboxers. The results presented in this study allow for the
verification of an experimental program based on CrossFit training. The idea of CrossFit
training is to introduce a component of competing with a training partner or oneself,
which increases the intensity and effectiveness of exercise [
24
]. The findings of the study
show that the experiment had a positive effect on the fitness level in the experimentalgroup,  which was confirmed by statistically significant changes.   Improvements wereobserved in abdominal muscle strength, shoulder girdle strength, and handgrip strength.
The development of general body strength is a basic component of the preparation of a
kickboxer to effectively use hand and foot techniques and to improve performance duringthe fight [
4
,
48
,
49
]. Furthermore, strength training is effective in protecting against injuries
that are common in contact sports [
50
,
51
].   The results of our research show that it is
advisable to use CrossFit training as a supplement to basic kickboxing training in the
preparation period. The experimental training also improved dynamic upper and lower
limb strength as measured by standing long jump and clap push-ups.  Muscle strengthof both upper and lower limbs is essential for the athlete to win in full-contact formulasin kickboxing such as K1,  low kick,  and full contact [
52
,
53
].   Taking into account the
significant changes, it can be concluded that the training used in the experiment led tothe increase in dynamic strength in the experimental group despite the lack of exercises
with additional external resistance. A high level of dynamic power allows for the effective
use of technical actions that affect the level of technical and tactical indices and thusfighting performance [
16
,
33
]. Another effect of the implemented training program was a
progression in speed, as confirmed by statistically significant changes recorded in the test
of speed of hand movements (plate tapping test) in the experimental group. Accordingly,the authors’ program induced improvements in upper limb speed in plate tapping andspecial fitness tests (punching speed). The relationship between these two components wasconfirmed by the high correlation between each other. It is worth noting that these abilities
play a key role in full-contact formula (K1, low kick, full contact), light forms (kick light,
light contact), and intermittent forms (point fighting) [
54
], as well as in any fight using
upper limbs (boxing, karate, etc.). According to Kimm and Theil, hand speed is especiallyimportant in boxing, both to protect against attack and throw punches [
55
]. A kickboxer
who delivers punches at a fast pace can effectively attack the opponent, anticipate their
intentions, and effectively defend against the opponent’s attack. A high frequency of upper
119

,
19
, 4526
limb movements and punches is highly desirable, especially in limited-contact formulas
where a point advantage determines victory [
9
]. The observed progression can be explained
by the use of plyometrics in the experimental training involving the upper limbs, such asburpees, combined with dynamic, explosive boxing actions on a bag. The purpose of theseactions was to develop the muscles’ ability to generate a large force in a short time (highforce rate) or improve dynamics [
56
]. In addition to these characteristics, agility, balance,
and coordination also play an important role in the training process [
15
]. An improvement
in the results after the experimental training was also observed in the agility test (shuttlerun). This ability determines the speed of movement, which is a precondition for effectivemovement in the fighting area and defense.  Furthermore, the ability to move quicklyand the footwork speed are the basis for meeting the technical and tactical objectives ofthe fight [
57
].
In the present study, a high correlation was observed in the experimental group be-
tween the hip-turning speed in the special fitness test and shuttle run results. Interpretationof the relationships leads to the conclusion that the kick speed, associated with hip turning,is determined by agility, with its components being coordination and speed [
2
,
15
]. There
was a significant increase in flexibility in the experimental group after the experimental
training program. Flexibility is one of the elements needed to master technical skills [
15
].
The sit-and-reach test showed the progression of flexibility in athletes in the study group.The improvements may be due to the training used, which included high kicks that re-
quired a large range of motion.  The Cooper Test, which measures the athlete’s aerobic
endurance level, showed small and statistically insignificant improvements in both groups.
This may be explained by high baseline levels of running endurance in the kickboxers
tested, whereas the specific kickboxing training and experimental training did not allow forsignificant development of this ability. It is worth noting that the higher level of the Coopertest results translates directly into higher special fitness, as evidenced by the high positivecorrelation with the total number of punches in the test. Furthermore, the experimentalgroup showed a statistically significant reduction in the physical fitness index in the SKFTtest, which indicates an improvement in the athletes’ special endurance. Favorable changes
were found in all special fitness parameters, i.e., the total number of punches, punching
speed, and hip-turning speed. This leads us to assume that the applied training based onthe components of CrossFit has a positive impact on the athlete’s performance, which ismeasured by the results of special fitness tests [
45
,
58
].
Limitation in the Study
A major limitation of our study was the lack of detailed verification of the study
groups. We were unable to conduct the experiment in a closed facility where both groups
would have the same conditions for functioning and training.  Furthermore, we did not
perform a direct test to evaluate VO
2
max based only on running endurance.
5. Conclusions
The experimental training program based on the principles of CrossFit training had
a positive effect on the physical fitness of the kickboxers in terms of strength, flexibility,agility, and speed indices in the experimental group. The experimental training programbased on the principles of CrossFit training had a positive effect on special physical fitness.
There were significant correlations in the parameters of special and general fitness, i.e.,
Cooper test vs. total of punches and kicks, shuttle run vs. hip-turning speed, and tapping
vs. punching speed after the experimental training program.
Practical Implication
The presented experimental training program can be implemented to improve the
quality of kickboxing training in terms of improving general and special physical fitness in
the preparation period.

Abstract:
Insufficient physical activity (PA) is one of major risk factors for serious diseases and
premature mortality worldwide. Public policies to enhance PA across society are recognized as an
effective tool against the problem. This paper presents the results of a comprehensive assessment ofnational-level PA policy approach in Poland. A standardized survey of Word Health Organizationnamed the Health-Enhancing Physical Activity Policy Audit Tool (HEPA PAT) was used for data col-lection. Content analysis and strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analysis (SWOT) wereused to characterize various PA policy aspects, to appraise the current situation, and accommodateorganizational and environmental factors that it is influenced by. The results show that the nationalPA policy approach has been constantly developing in Poland, but there is room for improvement ina number of areas. The most important weaknesses are the lack of clear leadership, no mechanismsin place to coordinate efforts undertaken at different levels, and lack of collaboration across differentlevels of government and across different sectors of economy. Providing an umbrella covering all PA
promotion policies and activities is, therefore, a key issue to be addressed. The country should seize
the opportunity coming from an increasing awareness of a healthy lifestyle among Polish society.Keywords:

1. Introduction
Non-communicable diseases are responsible for almost three quarters of global deaths [
1
],
and a lack of physical activity (PA) is one of their major risk factors [
2
,
3
].  Lee et al. [
4
]
estimated that 6% of the burden of coronary heart diseases, 7% of type 2 diabetes, 10% ofbreast cancers,  and 10% of colon cancers are caused by an inactive lifestyle.   He alsoestimated that with a 25% increase in global PA level, more than 1.3 million deaths couldbe averted each year.  Therefore, regular PA is an effective prevention strategy againstnumerous chronic diseases and may reduce their risk by 20–30% [
5
]. Despite the empirical
evidence on the health benefits of PA [
4
,
6
], over a quarter of the world’s adult population
and more than three quarters of the world’s adolescents do not adhere to current PA

guidelines [
7
].  In addition, no improvement has been noticed in global PA levels since
2001 [
7
]. For this reason, promotion of PA is a topic of great importance for both the World
Health Organization (WHO) and the European Union (EU) [
8
,
9
].
Since 1995, the WHO has been providing evidence-based recommendations for PA [
10
].
The newest were published in 2020 [
11
]. The document provides details on the amount,
type, and frequency of PA that is needed for health and well-being for specific populationgroups, such as small children, school-aged children, adults, the elderly, or pregnant women.
According to Oja and Titze [
10
], PA recommendations targeting individuals are insufficient
to achieve desired PA levels across the population, however, they may provide foundationsfor actions to improve the situation and metrics for their monitoring.  Thus, policies to
promote PA may be used as a response to the global physical inactivity problem. Compared
to individual-level interventions, policies are targeted at a broader audience, community,or population, and therefore, have a wider spectrum of influence [
12
].  Sallis et al. [
13
]
define PA-related policies as ‘legislative, regulatory, or policy-making actions that havethe potential to affect physical activity’.  They may provide opportunities for increasingPA levels, provide funding for PA promotion, regulate the amount of obligatory sports
at school, and coordinate activities undertaken at national or regional level [
12
,
14
]. Many
studies provide evidence for the effectiveness of policies to promote PA [
15
–
18
].  Such
policies have been successfully implemented in the areas of education, health, sport, urban
design, or transportation. Taking the latter as an example, Brockman and Fox [
19
] assessed
the impact of transport-related policies introduced in Bristol in 1997–2007 that includedincreasing parking fees, subsidies for bicycle purchases, introducing a car-sharing system,and public transport discounts, concluding that walking to work increased by 11%. Another
policy introduced in Cambridge, which focused on increasing access to walking/cycling
routes and places for PA, has significantly increased children’s PA levels [
20
].
According to the WHO [
21
], the central role in promoting healthy lifestyles and cre-
ating an environment that encourage behavior changes belongs to the governments. Therole is not limited to the health sector but also to other sectors such as transport, education,sports, or the environment. National governments have a steering and coordinating rolein implementing strategies and meeting recommendations developed by WHO [
21
,
22
]or
EU [
8
] at the national level. They have resources to provide effective legislations, develop
programs,  and ensure an appropriate infrastructure,  funding,  monitoring, or research
opportunities.   National policy is an important platform for governments to develop,coordinate and deliver large scale actions across multiple sectors, involve stakeholders,assign roles and responsibilities, define common objectives and gain visibility at the po-litical level [
23
]. However, not all countries use the potential their governments have in
PA promotion.
To assess the national PA policy potential and approaches, the WHO proposed a
policy audit tool (Health-Enhancing Physical Activity Policy Audit Tool—HEPA PAT) and
a wide variety of countries have used it so far [
24
–
27
]. The HEPA PAT is a standardized
questionnaire designed to collect comprehensive, systematic, and comparable data on the
approaches to PA promotion at the national policy level [
23
,
28
].  The completed HEPA
PAT questionnaire provides a comprehensive overview on the current status of a country’sapproach to enhancing PA, allows to identify strengths and weaknesses of the currentnational policy approach, indicates synergies and discrepancies between national level
policy documents, and identifies whether there is enough communication and collaboration
between sectors [
23
]. Finally, it allows for country comparisons [
23
,
24
], communication of
good practices, and success stories to be used by other countries.
This paper presents the results of a comprehensive assessment of national-level PA
policy approach in Poland based on the data systematically collected with the use of HEPA
PAT questionnaire.   The paper aims to answer the following questions:  What are thestrengths and weaknesses of the Polish PA policy approach?  What policy areas need tobe improved?  The findings from this study will contribute to advanced knowledge inthis particular area and to help policymakers and practitioners design and plan actions

to increase PA levels among the whole of society. The rationale for this study is aligned
with the work of the Policy Evaluation Network (PEN;
https://www.jpi-pen.eu/
). PEN
aims to develop a consolidated approach to policy evaluation across Europe by developingand prioritizing an agreed set of indicators, measured using harmonized instruments thatideally can be used by existing monitoring and surveillance systems [
29
]. This study was
also the first step in developing the prototype of ‘Physical Activity Environment PolicyIndex’, a tool that can be used to independently monitor and benchmark public sector PA
policies and actions.
2. Materials and Methods
To identify and assess the current state of the national-level PA policy approach in
Poland, the WHO’s audit tool HEPA PAT version 2.0 was used [
28
].  The questionnaire
consists of 29 questions in 10 subject areas (Table
1
). The process of completing the HEPA
PAT was supervised by the project coordinator (J
 ̇
Z) and involved national stakeholders
from several sectors such as sports, health, education, and transport.

The process of data collection started in March 2019 and was completed in July 2019.
It consisted of the following stages:  (i) identification of stakeholders; (ii) collecting thedata from the 2018 survey for the EU Monitoring Framework after obtaining consentfrom the national PA Focal Point and the WHO; (iii) desk research conducted by theauthors, including the identification and the review of existing policy documents, programs,activities carried out at the national level and related to PA promotion; (iv) in-depth expertinterviews to obtain additional information and input for the HEPA PAT; (v) completing theHEPA PAT questionnaire by the authors. The in-depth interviews with experts involvedthe representatives of the Polish Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Sport and Tourism,the Ministry of Infrastructure, and the Ministry of Education (currently the Ministry ofEducation and Science). The participants were selected based on their expertise in the PA
policy setting and policy implementation.
Similarly, data were collected in Ireland, The Netherlands, and Germany [
23
,
24
,
27
].
While the results of this four-country comparison have been published elsewhere, this
article presents the results for Poland in a higher level of detail.
In order to characterize the various policy aspects related to the development, imple-
mentation, monitoring, and evaluation of PA policies, a content analysis of the completedHEPA PAT questionnaire was performed.  This is a research technique widely used formaking inferences from analyzing documents that were generated or obtained in the courseof research [
30
].  The HEPA PAT categories served as basic themes for the analysis.  The
research questions were raised to understand the information of how it is presented: Howis the process (e.g., implementation, evaluation) organized? What are the outcomes? Whatlacks in the process?  The conclusions were drawn from the HEPA PAT content to thecontext, which is the history and current state of PA policy approach in Poland, using theexperience and knowledge by researchers directly involved in the data collection process.
To summarize the results, a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats)
analysis was used. This is a powerful tool widely used in strategic planning and manage-ment, which is helpful to appraise the state of the art and accommodate organizational andenvironmental factors that influence the current situation [
31
]. SWOT analyses have been
adopted in some qualitative studies to evaluate policy approaches in recent years, includ-ing energy planning strategies [
32
,
33
], the compressed natural gas industry, [
34
] or urban
transport system [
35
]. It has also been applied to evaluate PA promotion in a household
group survey [
36
].  In this paper, SWOT is used to structure the factors influencing and
shaping PA promotion policy at the national level in Poland. For this purpose, the particu-lar components of SWOT representing internal (strengths and weaknesses) and external
(opportunities and threats) factors, respectively, were summarized in a 2
×
2 matrix. The
matrix components were further divided into rows comprising factors in accordance withthe adopted themes and matching them horizontally (i.e., strengths with corresponding
weaknesses; opportunities with corresponding threats).
3. Results3.1. Leadership and Partnership
Poland is a unitary state with a strong central government.   In line with the EU
recommendations on promoting health-enhancing PA (HEPA) across sectors [
8
], Poland
has appointed a National PA Focal Point at the Ministry of Sport and Tourism, Departmentof Sport. The Ministry is responsible for the development and implementation of nationalsport and tourism strategies. It undertakes many activities to promote PA, but these arelimited mainly to the area of sport. The Ministry does not provide any leadership and anyumbrella for PA promotion activities implemented in other areas (i.e., health, transportation,and social policy).
Apart from the Ministry of Sport and Tourism, other government ministries have their
own role in PA promotion. Table
2
presents information about ministries, their responsi-
bilities, and how they are related to PA promotion.  The Ministry of Health, responsiblefor health policy, develops and implements the national health strategy, which covers
128

PA-related tasks.  The Ministry of Family and Social Policy, responsible for the welfareof Polish families and the whole society, supports the development of care services andcares for the PA of seniors. The Ministry of Education and Science, responsible for teachingand education, supports the development of educational programs, including physicaleducation (PE) classes at schools. Although the Ministry of Infrastructure, the Ministry ofInvestment and Development, and the Ministry of the Environment do not have specialroles in PA promotion, they indirectly support PA by different programs devoted to activetransport, active mobility, and development of green transport.

There are currently no special mechanisms or agencies to ensure the co-operation
between particular ministries in the implementation of the PA policies at the national level.
There is also no agency at the national level to promote and coordinate PA activities with
the subnational level, either horizontally or vertically.3.2. Policy Documents
The most important policy documents that influenced the shaping of the PA policy
agenda in Poland were the National Health Programme 2007–2015 [
37
], the Sport Develop-
ment Strategy until 2015 [
38
], and the Directions of Tourism Development until 2015 [
39
].
These programs covered the sectors of sport, health, education, and tourism. All were con-
tinued and covered the period until 2020 [
39
–
41
]. In addition to the mentioned programs,
there are policy documents in other sectors that have implications for PA behavior; theseare the Transport Development Strategy until 2020 [
42
] which appeared in transport sector,
and the National Urban Policy 2023 [
43
], which is rooted in the urban planning sector. Key
policy documents related to PA promotion are listed in Table
3
.
While there are a number of current key policy documents expressing the intention
to increase the national level of PA (e.g., [
39
–
41
,
44
]), there are no clear references across
these documents and links to other documents. The only existing links refer to policies atthe European level. An example is the Sport Development Programme 2020 [
41
], which
takes the European Commission’s White Paper on Sport [
45
] as a basic document setting
strategic guidelines for the role of sport in Europe and Poland.

3.3. Policy Scope and Implementation
Nearly all population groups, including preschool children, adolescents, individuals
with disabilities, clinical populations, families, and migrant populations, are covered in the
documents identified.
Although there is no nationwide mass media communication strategy to promote PA
in Poland, some agencies are funding initiatives that utilize mass media, i.e., social mediachannels. However, no coordination of these initiatives is ensured.
On the other hand, there are many successful programs and interventions in Poland
promoting PA in sectors such as health, sport, education, transport, and environment.
The most successful and widespread programs in recent years were the National Talent
Base, the Local Sports Animator, the Orlik 2012, and the Stop Abstention from PE Classes
(Table
4
).

A program which provided for the construction of modern sport
facilities in every municipality in Poland.
Stop Abstention
from PE Classes
A program aimed at promoting PA among school-aged children
and adolescents and encouraging them to attend PE classes.
3.4. PA Recommendations, Goals and Targets
Poland has official guidelines for recommended levels of PA in different age groups,
including children of all ages, adults, and seniors [
46
].  In case of adults, the recommen-
dations are also targeted to pregnant women and adults with chronic diseases, but notto people with disabilities.  The document is based on the WHO recommendations and
considers the results of the study on PA among Poles conducted in the years 2015–2017. Therecommendations set minimum and optimal time of weekly PA recommended in particulargroups and propose the type and intensity of activity that should be undertaken, i.e., forseniors, it is recommended to undertake 150 min of moderate PA per week, includingexercises to improve balance, coordination, and to strengthen all body muscles.

Sedentary behavior is not addressed by any national recommendations.  This is an
important weakness of the Polish PA promotion system, while many countries provide
recommendations in this regard (i.e., Estonia, Greece, and France) [
47
].
Improving the PA levels in Poland was the main goal of the Sport Development
Programme 2020 [
41
]. According to the program, the percentage of residents that undertake
the recommended amount of PA was to be increased by 3.5% and the percentage of residents
that never do exercise or play sport was to be lined up with the EU average.  Mid-termevaluation indicates that even though the situation has improved, Poland is still far awayfrom achieving these goals [
48
].
3.5. Surveillance
Poland has been conducting regular PA monitoring among different age groups for
the past ten years. In 2016, the country joined the WHO’s European Childhood ObesitySurveillance Initiative (COSI) [
49
].  Within the initiative and financed by the National
Health Programme [
40
], a standardized survey and body measurements were conducted
among 8-year-olds in 2016 and 2018. The results of the study provide information on thelevel of PA and sedentary behavior of school pupils.  According to the latest results, alarge proportion (61%) of children do 1–2 h of PA daily, however there is also a significant
proportion (10–20% depending on the type of day) who are not active at all. The time spent
on watching TV or using electronic media is approximately 1.5 h on an average school dayand 2.5 h during non-school days.
Since 2010, Poland has been carrying out the regular monitoring of PA among children
aged 11–15 using the HBSC methodology [
50
]. The studies were conducted in 2010, 2014,
and 2018.   The latest study [
51
] showed that the recommended PA level in Poland is
achieved only by 17.2% of teenagers. Most of the teenagers (approx. 60% during workingdays and 80% during weekend) spend more than two hours a day sitting in front of TV,computer, tablet, or smartphone, and this percentage is increasing.
Pilot studies are also carried out in other age groups, e.g., among older youth (17–19)
and in pre-school children. The health and PA level among Polish residents have also beena subject of a study based on the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS) [
52
] in 2009,
2014, and 2019. Since 2014, the Ministry of Sport and Tourism has been committing researchon the PA levels of Polish residents on an annual basis, using the International Physical
Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) [
53
]. The aim of the study is to indicate the percentage of
Polish residents meeting the WHO’s recommendations regarding the time spent on PA
(according to the latest results these are met by only 21.8% of residents aged 15–69 [
54
]).
A regular monitoring of PA is also provided by the Main Statistical Office (2008, 2012,
and 2016), using a questionnaire survey in households. The respondents are asked abouttheir perceived physical fitness and the level and regularity of PA.
Despite the amount of data collected and updated in the above-mentioned studies,
most policy documents do not take the results into account. The exception is the NationalSport Development Programme 2020 [
41
], whose goals were based on the diagnosis using
surveillance data, as well as the data used for program monitoring. The existing data arealso not commonly used for PA promotion activities. However, some good practices can befound. In 2009–2012, the National Supreme Audit Office has investigated the organizationof PE classes and the levels of participation. The results were alarming—physical fitnessamong children decreased, they often had bad posture, and they experienced the fastest
weight increase in Europe.  The PE classes were also neglected by schools and teachers;
according to the results, 65% of the classes were not even conducted.  In response, theMinistry of Sport and Tourism has initiated the promotional campaign Stop Abstention
from PE classes (Table
4
), which aimed to fight against the scourge of PE exemptions and
increasing parents’ awareness about the importance of PA for children’s health and fitness.

3.6. Evaluation
Among the policies in place, only the National Sport Development Programme [
41
]
was developed based on previous program evaluation results and includes a detailed
evaluation plan. The evaluation is done at the strategic (achievement of program goals)
and operational level (implementation of the program action plan). An evaluation report is
published on an annual basis.
One-time evaluation was also done for the National Health Programme [
55
]. How-
ever, this evaluation was only based on the qualitative assessment of the organization of
particular initiatives and their strengths and weaknesses, but did not assess whether the
goals of the program were achieved.3.7. Funding and Commitments
According to the Ministry of Finance, in 2015, public expenditure on sport and PA
amounted to 1.1 billion euro, of which over 90% was spent by local governments.  This
means that local governments play a key role in financing sport and recreation from publicsources. Local government units allocate much more funds to physical activity promotionthan the state budget.  The public expenditures on sport and PA represent 0.4% of thenational GDP [
56
].  The budget spent per capita was 43 euro in 2015 and increased to
60 euro in 2019; however, it is still 50% lower than the EU average [
57
,
58
].
At the national level, the delivery of PA-related policy is funded from several sectors
(public funds).  The largest funding comes from the sport and recreation sector and the
transport sector; much less is dedicated from the sectors of health, education, tourism andsocial affairs.  A large amount (70 million euro) was dedicated for financing initiatives
within the National Sport Development Programme [
38
].
3.8. Capacity Building through a National Network
National networks that support professionals in PA promotion primarily include
publicly funded associations and informal networks. An example is the National Talent
Base (
https://www.narodowabazatalentow.pl
), which collects and shares data and knowl-
edge about the level of physical condition of children and adolescents as well as helps todiscover young talents in sport. Another example is the Polish Active Mobility Association
(PUMA) that supports local governments in promoting and improving conditions for
active transport.3.9. Summary
Table

summarizes the results of the Polish HEPA PAT obtained from both the expert
interviews  and  the  Polish  HEPA  Focal  Point  with  the  help  of  the  SWOT  analysis.   Itindicates the strengths and weaknesses of the PA policy approach and highlights externalopportunities and threats that may influence its future development.
Table 5.
SWOT analysis of PA promotion in Poland.
Strengths
Weaknesses
There is a WHO focal point designated in the Ministry of
Sport and Tourism.
There is no leader agency (nor leadership) responsible
for PA promotion.
There are ministries directly (sport) and indirectly
(i.e., health, transportation, and social policy) involved
in PA promotion.
There is no cross-sectoral coordination on the national level. There is no
link between policies, programs, and interventions implemented by
different bodies (e.g., ministries) and no coordination of their activities.
There is no vertical coordination between national and local level PA
promotion activities. There is no umbrella strategy at the national level
(the implemented programs and interventions are not a part of any
wider PA promotion strategy).

Strengths
Weaknesses
There is a PA promotion policy in place (the National
Sport Development Programme).
There are several policies that indirectly link to PA
promotion (in the area of i.e., health or transportation).
There are many successful programs and interventions
to promote PA in sectors like health, sports, education,
transport, and environment.
A clear PA promotion policy is limited to the area of sport. There is no
central policy document that would serve as an umbrella for PA-related
policies in the areas of sport, health, transportation, etc.
There is a regular monitoring of PA levels across
different society groups, especially children
and adolescents.
There is a publicly available tool (the National Talent
Base) to measure physical fitness among youth using
systematic measurements.
The existing monitoring tools and methods do not account for different
external and internal conditions (e.g., age of participants and
weather conditions).
There is no evaluation of implemented programs and interventions;
new programs and interventions are usually not based on previous
evaluation results.
National recommendations on increasing PA include a
wide range of age and social groups; including pregnant
women and elderly people.
No recommendations are targeted at people with disabilities.
There are no national recommendations on reducing sedentary
behavior among different population groups.
The existing policy documents strongly refer to the
relevant European policies.
There are no clear cross-sectoral links between policy documents.
There is no national communication strategy regarding PA promotion.
Opportunities
Threats
There is an increasing awareness of a healthy lifestyle
among Polish society; it is trendy to be active and fit.
There is a social tolerance for inactivity.
Sedentary behavior is progressing in society; there is an alarming and
increasing trend in time spent in front of electronic devices, especially
among children, adolescents, and young adults.
Availability of open sport infrastructure constantly
increase (e.g., new outdoor gyms are financed by
governmental program).
Financing of new PA infrastructure and opportunities strongly depends
on the country’s economic situation which is not constant.
There are many bottom-up initiatives by local
governments and NGOs that supports PA promotion
(promotional campaigns, competitions, mass events,
marathons, etc.).
Implementation of many PA promotion interventions is affected by and
depends on COVID-19 conditions.
There are structures in Polish parliament responsible for
PA promotion related tasks.
The activity of parliament’s structures designated to promote PA is very
low and isolated.
4. Discussion
HEPA PAT turned out to be a powerful tool for identifying the strengths and weak-
nesses of PA policy approach in Poland. The summary of results of its application presentedin Table
5
allows conclusions to be drawn on what are the successes, what are the failures,
where is a room for improvement, and what needs to be done from scratch regarding the
efforts to increase the national PA level.
It is clear that the most important weakness of the Polish PA policy approach is the
lack of clear leadership and the lack of mechanisms to coordinate efforts at different levelsand to ensure effective collaboration (both vertically across different levels of governmentand horizontally across different sectors). In the meantime, governments are encouragedby the WHO to set up a national coordinating mechanism that addresses PA within thecontext of a comprehensive plan for noncommunicable-disease prevention and health
promotion. Local authorities should be closely involved. WHO recommendations underlie
that multisectoral and multidisciplinary expert advisory boards should be established.
They should include technical experts and representatives of government agencies, and
have an independent chair to ensure that scientific evidence is interpreted without anyconflict of interest [
21
]. None of these currently exist in Poland.
There are government structures that are actively promoting PA in the areas they are
responsible for (i.e., sports, health, urban policy, transport, etc.), but their potential as policymakers is untapped. Their actions are undertaken independently and without linkage to
133

IJERPH
2022
,
19
, 7284
policies in other sectors, even when they have the same goal of making the Polish society
healthier and more active.
Not only governmental structures, but also many processes, are already in place and
dealing with PA promotion. Providing an umbrella covering all PA policies and activitiesis, therefore, an extremely important issue to be addressed in Poland. This is exactly whatthe WHO [
21
] recommended to its member states, emphasizing that it is governments that
create the conditions for change in promotion of healthy lifestyles.
There are also strengths of the Polish PA policy approach. One of these is a regular
PA monitoring.   Data are collected in different population groups (i.e.,  adults,  school-aged children, and adolescents) and mostly on a regular basis, with the use of different
methodologies. However, the existing monitoring tools and methods do not account fordifferent external and internal conditions that may be influential (e.g.,  age group and
weather conditions). The surveillance data come mainly from self-reported surveys (e.g.,
IPAQ). According to Winckers et al. [
59
], who compared IPAQ results with accelerometer
data, using subjective PA measures leads to a general overestimation of PA; low data validityis especially observed in a lower-educated adult group. This may raise a question of validityof the surveillance data, which is not complemented with objective measurements.
Despite the amount of data being collected, these are rarely used in policy formulation
or evaluation. The only policy document that is based upon the data and uses these data for
evaluation is the National Sport Development Program [
41
], developed by the Ministry of
Sport and Tourism. Lack of a clear evaluation plan makes it impossible to monitor whetherother programs or interventions have met their objectives and how they should be changedin the future to be more effective. With single exemptions, the data are also not used for PA
promotion or communicated to the society.
Based on WHO guidelines [
11
], Poland sets the recommended daily PA for most
population groups. However, the recommendations are communicated to the society to
a low extent.  It is not evaluated to what extent people are aware of their existence.  An
important problem identified during the HEPA PAT data collection process was the lack ofPolish recommendations on reducing sedentary behavior, which affects a large share of
population [
57
].
While the surveillance data enable regular monitoring and evaluation, not all major
policy documents have an evaluation plan included. The need for improvement in policy
evaluation both in Poland and in other countries was also highlighted by Gelius et al. [
24
].
The results of this study show the potential of the efforts taken so far in improving
PA level across society.  Numerous actions are undertaken at different levels; different
policy documents are in place, different sectors are engaged, and a large amount of data are
collected. What is missing is effective coordination making the linkage between differentactivities and bodies engaged, and between actions undertaken at different levels (i.e.,national, regional, and local).  Poland may benefit from this comprehensive assessmentin numerous ways.  The country may use the results to prioritize actions regarding PA
promotion that has to be undertaken and formulate recommendations for further activities.
The methodology may be used by the country in order to monitor particular areas of PA
policy approach. Other countries may also benefit from this comprehensive assessment.
They may use the adopted methodology in order to identify strengths and weaknesses of
their PA promotion policy approach; they may use the results to identify and compare the
weak and strong points of the PA policy. Finally, they may use some practices that were
assessed as successful in Poland.
The present study suffers from some limitations. The research was conducted at the
national level only, and no regional or local level PA-related activities were included. Thus,the subnational level requires investigation and will be a subject of further research.
As data collection took place in 2019, the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on
policies promoting physical activity in Poland could not be assessed in this study.

5. Conclusions
The study provides a comprehensive overview and assessment of the efforts under-
taken to promote PA at the national level in Poland. The results confirm that the national PA
policy approach has been constantly developing in Poland and currently includes multiple
sectors and covers major population groups, although there is still room for improvementin most fields. While the need for improvement is recognized in most countries [
24
,
60
], lack
of clear leadership and coordination of policies in Poland is almost an impassable barrierin increasing effectiveness of PA promotion in Poland. The findings from this study mayhelp policymakers and practitioners design and plan actions to increase PA levels amongthe whole of society.Supplementary  Materials:

Abstract:
Obesity is a complex multifactorial abnormality that has a well-confirmed genetic basis.
However, the problem still lies in identifying the polymorphisms linked to body mass and composi-tion. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze associations between
FTO
(rs9939609),
FABP2
(rs1799883),
and
LEP
(rs2167270),
LEPR
(rs1137101), and
MC4R
(rs17782313) polymorphisms and obesity-related
parameters. Unrelated Caucasian males (
n
= 165) were recruited. All participants had similar physical
activity levels. The participants were divided into two groups depending on their body mass index
(BMI) and fat mass index (FMI). All samples were genotyped using real-time polymerase chain
reaction (real-time PCR). When tested individually, only one statistically significant result was found.
The
FTO
A/T polymorphism was significantly associated with FMI (
p
= 0.01). The chance of having
increased FMI was >2-fold higher for the
FTO
A allele carriers (
p
< 0.01).  Gene–gene interaction
analyses showed the additional influence of all investigated genes on BMI and FMI. In summary,it was demonstrated that harboring the
FTO
A allele might be a risk factor for elevated fat mass.
Additionally, this study confirmed that all five polymorphisms are involved in the development of
common obesity in the studied population and the genetic risk of obesity is linked to the accumulationof numerous variants.Keywords:

1. Introduction
Obesity is defined as excessive body weight gain due to an increased accumulation of
body fat that presents a leading cause of the largest public health problems [
1
], since nearly
40% of adults are overweight and 10–15% are obese worldwide [
2
]. Obesity phenotypes
are associated with a higher risk of many medical problems such as cardiovascular events,metabolic disorders, type 2 diabetes, neuropsychiatric disorders, and some types of cancer,the majority of which can lead to elevated mortality risk [
3
–
6
].  An analysis of the latest
work in the literature has shown that modifiable factors positively affect our well-being and
health. The best effect can be achieved by combining positive actions in the field of diet,supplementation, moderate but systematic physical activity, and adding the right amountof sleep per day [

Obesity  is  a  complex  multifactorial  disease  that  has  a  well-confirmed  strong  ge-
netic basis but needs behavioral,  developmental,  and/or environmental influences to
develop
[
1
,
9
,
10
]
. Several studies have demonstrated the role of lifestyle, including caloric
intake and physical activity level, in the regulation of body weight [
11
,
12
]. However, the
problem still lies in identifying the genes and polymorphic sites related to obesity and
describing the biological mechanisms by which they exert their effects [
9
].
Although studies of the common obesity genetics were determined by genome-wide
association studies (GWASs), this stage was set by research on monogenic obesity, whichemphasized that the leptin–melanocortin signaling pathway is the major regulator of foodintake.  Several genes involved in the development of monogenic obesity are in or nearloci subsequently linked by GWASs with obesity-related traits.  To date, over 600 genesand chromosomal regions have been associated with the regulation of body weight andcomposition [
9
,
13
]. The genetic risk of common obesity is linked to the accumulation of
numerous loci, each contributing a small part of the total obesity risk [
9
]. Therefore, the
analysis of haplotypes and interactions between candidate genes are more informative
than methods based on individual signal-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and might giveadditional information important for understanding complex interactions between variousgene variants [
14
,
15
]. Consequently, in our study, we decided to analyze five of the most
promising polymorphic sites localized within obesity-related genes: fat mass and obesity-
associated (
FTO
), fatty acid-binding protein 2 (
FABP2
), leptin (
LEP
), leptin receptor (
LEPR
),
and melanocortin-4 receptor (
MC4R
), which are characterized in Table
1
[
9
,
16
–
22
].  The
genes were selected based on a literature review and our own previous studies. Recently,studies have confirmed that these SNPs are linked to obesity-related traits such as BMI, hipcircumference, total body weight, body fat percentage, and cardiometabolic traits, amongothers. The noted associations are replicable across different ethnic populations as well as
various age groups [
9
,
13
,
16
–
22
]. Guilherme et al. (2019) suggested that SNPs, which can
affect body composition parameters, might influence physical performance [
23
].

The above-mentioned findings highlight the selected genes’ association with body
mass and body composition parameters.  However, the results are inconsistent and the
interactions between these candidate genes are still unknown. Thus, this study aimed to ex-amine the associations between

(rs9939609),

distribution in a group of physically active Caucasian men measured for selected bodymass and body composition traits.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Participants
One hundred and sixty-five unrelated military professionals were selected for this
study. All participants were aged 19–54 years, ancestrally fitted (all volunteers were Polishand Eastern Europe residents for 3 generations), and they represented similar physicalactivity levels. The experimental protocols used in this study were conducted in accordance
with the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki and were positively verified
by the Ethics Committee of the Military Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (no. 1/XXI
/2016). The participants received an information sheet regarding the research details, aim
of the study and procedures applied, as well as potential risks and benefits associated withtheir participation. All volunteers gave written, informed consent for the genotyping, andthey were informed that the study will be anonymous and the results would be private.2.2. Body Composition Measurements
Height was measured using a portable stadiometer (without shoes) (TANITA HR-001,
Tanita Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Body composition (including fat %) and body weight
were measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) using the TANITA MC-780
machine (Tanita Corporation, Japan) with an accuracy of 0.1 kg according to the procedurespecified in the instruction manual (lightly dressed, without shoes). All measurements were
performed according to the procedure specified in the instruction manual and without any
metal objects. The following parameters were noted: BMI (kg/m
2
), height (cm), weight (kg),
fat mass index (FMI; kg/m
2
)[
24
], visceral tissue index (VTI; level), and fat
percentage (%)
.
The participants (
n
= 165) were divided into two groups depending on their BMI
(body weight/height
2
; kg/m
2
).  The control group (CON
BMI
;
n
= 77) comprised people
with BMI between 20.0 and 25.0,  while the overweight group (OVER
BMI
;
n
= 88) had
a BMI of
≥
25.0.  They were also divided into two groups depending on their FMI (fat
mass/height
2
; kg/m
2
).  FMI values between 3 and 6 were classified as normal fat mass;
FMI lower than 3 —fat deficit; FMI higher than 6—excess fat.  Participants whose FMI
values were 6 and lower were classified into the CON
FMI
group (
n
= 124), while those
whose FMI values were higher than 6 were grouped into the OVER
FMI
group (
n
= 41).
Statistically significant differences between participants in both groups were observed for
parameters BMI (kg/m
2
), age (years), weight (kg), FMI (kg/m
2
), VTI (level) and Fat(%)
(
p
-value < 0.01). No statistically significant difference was shown in the parameter height
(cm) (
p
-value = 0.81
, 0.34) (Table
2
).  Detailed characteristics of experimental groups are
given in Table

according to the manufacturer’s protocols.  DNA samples of good quality and quantity
were stored at -20
◦
C. The exclusion criteria were: failure in DNA extraction; DNA degra-
dation; abnormal gene detection results; incomplete basic information. All samples weregenotyped in duplicate, using TaqMan Pre-De-signed SNP Genotyping Assays, which aregiven in Table
3
(Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA) on a CFX Connect Real-Time
PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’srecommendations.  The assays contained primers and fluorescently labeled (FAM and
VIC) minor groove binder (MGB) probes. The real-time PCR conditions were as follows:
5 min of initial denaturation (95
◦
C), then 40 cycles of denaturation (15 s,  95
◦
C) and
annealing/extension (60 s, 60

2.4. Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using the program R (version 2.0-1, The R Foun-
dation for Statistical Computing;
https://cran.r-project.org
(accessed on
20 September 2021
)).
Anthropometric data are shown as mean values
±
standard deviation and differences
among experimental groups were analyzed with Student’s t-test which was statistically
significant when
p
< 0.05. To check the compliance of the variables with the normal distri-
bution, the Shapiro–Wilk test was used and Levene’s test was used for verification of thehomogeneity of variance. Single-locus analysis was performed considering four geneticmodels (codominant, dominant, recessive and overdominant) and was calculated with theSNPassoc package for R. The models were constructed concerning the minor allele and
were checked adjusted by age as a potential factor influencing the result. FDR-adjusted
p
-values were calculated with the fdrtool package for R. An odds ratio (OR) was used as a
measure of association between an exposure and an outcome and to determine whether a
particular genotype is a risk factor for being overweight. The Akaike information criterion
(AIC) was used to evaluate how well a model fits the data.  A genetic model-free Multi-
factor dimensionality reduction (MDR) was used to detect the influence of the common
effect of gene
×
gene interactions on BMI and FMI, and it was calculated with MDR3.0.2
(
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mdr/
(accessed on 20 September 2021)); chi-square test
was used for checking the statistical significance of the model. Balance accuracy was used as
the evaluation measure to rank potential models and cross-validation consistency was used
to choose the best models. The association of single alleles with BMI was calculated withPearson’s chi-squared test with the STAT package for R. The level of statistical significance
was set at the level of
p
< 0.05. Genotype frequencies were analyzed using Fisher’s exact
test with the STAT package for R.3. Results
All genotype frequencies did not significantly different from the Hardy–Weinberg
equilibrium expectations in the OVER

group (
p
-values range from 0.10 to 1.00), CON

gene polymorphism (rs9939609) was significantly associated with FMI ex-
ceeding 6 (Table
6
). An association was found for the codominant (AA vs. TT), dominant
(AT-AA vs. TT), and for the recessive genetic models (AA vs. TT-AT). The chance of being
OVER
FMI
for the combination AA was over 4.7 times greater than for the combination TT
in the codominant model (Fisher ’s exact test
p
= 0.01). The chance of being OVER
FMI
for the
combination AT-AA was >2.7 times higher than for the combination TT in the dominantmodel (Fisher’s exact test
p
= 0.02). The chance of being OVER
FMI
for the combination AA
was >2.8 times higher than for the combination TT-AT in the codominant model (Fisher’s
exact test
p
= 0.02).  Moreover, the chance of being OVER
FMI
was >2.0-fold higher for
A allele
with Pearson’s chi-squared test
p
-value < 0.01. The model was supplemented with
age as a potential factor influencing the result, because of statistical differences shownbetween groups for this variable (Table

4. Discussion
In the present study, we examined the allele and genotype distributions of the
FTO
(rs9939609),
FABP2
(rs1799883),
LEP
(rs2167270),
LEPR
(rs1137101), and
MC4R
(rs17782313)
polymorphisms in a group of Caucasian men, who were divided into groups depending
on their BMI and FMI. When tested individually,  our statistical analyses showed thatharboring the specific
FTO
genotype might be associated with FMI, which measures relative
fat content. This association was found for the codominant (A/A vs. T/T), dominant (A/T-
A/A vs. T/T), and also for the recessive genetic model (A/A vs. T/T-A/T). The chance
of having an increased FMI was over two times higher for the
FTO
A allele carriers. This
observation constitutes the first important finding of the present study,  implying thatharboring this specific allele is unfavorable for some individuals.   The carriers of the
A allele might have an increased accumulation of body fat and a higher risk of many
obesity-related disorders.
In 2007, three independent groups demonstrated that a cluster of polymorphisms
in the
FTO
first intron was strongly related to body mass and composition parameters
and predisposes to overweight and obesity in children,  teenagers,  and adults [
25
–
27
].
Since then, many studies have proved that the
FTO
variants, especially the common A/T
polymorphism (rs9939609), are significantly linked to obesity-related traits, e.g., BMI, FMI,
body fat percentage, hip circumference, cardiometabolic traits, and many obesity-relatedmedical problems.  These associations are found across various ethnic populations and
144

IJERPH
2022
,
19
, 6030
different age groups [
18
,
25
–
29
].   The A allele,  identified as the risk allele,  is linked to
increased appetite and reduced satiety, a higher intake of dietary protein and fat, poor
eating habits, and loss of control overeating, among others [
18
]. Consequently, it has been
linked to the development of overweight and obesity, increasing the risk by
20–30%
. About
16% of examined individuals are homozygous for the A alleles and these people weigh
~3 kg
more than those without the risk allele [
24
]. In a previous study including 201 young
women from Poland, the A allele was also associated with higher BMI [
29
]. Additionally,
Zmijewski and Leo  ́
nska-Duniec showed that the SNP within the
FTO
gene can influence
athlete status in a study involving 196 elite swimmers and 379 control participants, who
were all Caucasians. They found that harboring the T allele might be favorable for achieving
success in sports such as swimming [
30
]. These results are in accordance with our study,
which confirms that harboring the A allele is unfavorable for Polish men, who might have
an increased accumulation of body fat.  These results suggest that the
FTO
(rs9939609)
polymorphism  is  a  candidate  marker  for  affecting  body  mass  and  body  composition
parameters in the Caucasian population.
A few potential biological mechanisms underlying the relationship between the
FTO
polymorphism and body mass and composition parameters have been revealed.   The
research has indicated that these associations are mediated through their functional interac-tions with distal surrounding genes. The first intron of the
FTO
gene contains a binding site
for the transcriptional factor—cut-like homeobox 1 (CUX1). Through controlling retinitis
pigmentosa GTPase regulator interacting protein 1 (RPGRIP1L) expression, it interacts
with the leptin receptor [
27
,
31
]. The leptin signaling is mediated by this specific receptor,
which in turn regulates food intake and energy expenditure [
16
]. Additionally, the
FTO
intron also includes an enhancer sequence, which interacts with the iroquois homeobox
3 (IRX3)
promoter region, and thus the
FTO
SNPs regulate IRX3 expression in the human
brain.  The IRX3 relationship with obesity and the process of browning in adipose cellshas been described [
27
,
31
,
32
]. Currently, some studies have indicated that the
FTO
gene is
closely related to the regulation of levels of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factorI (IGF-1). IGF-1 is a crucial hormone in the development of metabolic syndrome, due to itsinfluence on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism [
33
].
When the results obtained in our study were incorporated into the complex gene–
gene interaction analysis, the novel finding was that all five studied polymorphisms areinvolved in the formation of obesity-related traits in the Caucasian population.  Theseresults imply that some individuals might benefit from carrying some combinations ofgenotypes. It was shown that for the two-locus model—

the BMI and FMI division genotypes,  TT

FTO
present when there was an association with the absence of overweight shown (both for BMI
and FMI). In all models, when
FTO
was included, the genotypes TT and AT were linked
with a lack of overweight, confirming that harboring the
FTO
T allele might be favorable
for some individuals.
Although  the  analysis  of  individual  SNPs  showed  only  one  association  between
harboring the specific
FTO
genotype and FMI, the gene–gene interaction analysis revealed
numerous links between the genotypes of studied genes and obesity-related traits. Thisobservation confirmed that the genetic risk of obesity is connected with the accumulationof numerous variants;  thus,  methods based on numerous SNPs are more informativethan methods based on a single polymorphism.  Cole et al.  showed that the analysis of
145

IJERPH

19
, 6030
gene–gene interactions is a potential source of unexplained heritability, a significant focusof research into complex traits, including obesity, which involves a complex interactionbetween several genetic variants.  Such polygenic traits frequently require etiologies in
which complicated biological relations within different tissues, pathways, and networks
underlie the trait development [
15
]. Studying gene–gene interactions has been especially
important in the context of obesity [
34
], which is in accordance with our results.
Although numerous studies refer to the analysis of individual SNPs, which were
selected for the present study, the literature on gene–gene interaction analyses is scarce.
Therefore, the obtained results cannot be discussed with direct comparisons to other studies.
In the study including 2386 individuals, De et al. analyzed interactions between twelvegenetic variants robustly associated with obesity (
BDNF
,
ETV5
,
FAIM2
,
FTO
,
GNPDA2
,
KCTD15
,
MC4R
,
MTCH2
,
NEGR1
,
SEC16B
,
SH2B1
, and
TMEM18
). The authors underlined
that the used methodology made it possible to reveal the background of interactionsbetween genes known to influence BMI. They characterized the complicated interactions,emphasized new roles of the genes and highlight the involvement of regulatory frameworksin the development of obesity;  e.g., rs17066891 in
MC4R
was identified as having the
strongest main effect within this network, rs9940128 in
FTO
was identified as having the
second strongest main effect in the network, and rs4358154 in
TMEM18
had the highest
score for all measures which highlights the potentially significant role of this variant inthe context of obesity [
34
]. In a study including 290 overweight/obese participants and
288 normal-weight controls, Rana et al.  examined the effects of gene–gene and gene–
environment interactions on the obesity risk in the Pakistani population. They analyzed thefive obesity-associated genetic variants (
MC4R
rs17782313,
BDNF
rs6265,
FTO
rs1421085,
TMEM18
rs7561317, and
NEGR1
rs2815752). Surprisingly, the gene–gene interaction was
not found to significantly influence any obesity-related anthropometric phenotype, such asBMI or body fat percentage [
35
].
The study group was very homogeneous, which is a strong point of our study. Par-
ticipants had the same living conditions, physical activity levels, and meals, and yet thedifferences in the parameters related to body weight were statistically significant.  Thisallows most of the environmental factors to be ruled out and might indicate a geneticbackground for the increased body weight.  A potential limitation of our experiment is
rather the small group size of the participants, which might not show the statistical powernecessary to yield a meaningful analysis and the interpretation of the results. Previously,differences between sexes contribute to variation in the obesity-related traits such as levelsof fasting glucose and insulin were described.  Lagou et al.  (2021) indicated that fastinginsulin in women shows stronger genetic correlations than in men with waist-to-hip ratioand anorexia nervosa [
36
]. Unfortunately, this study only included adult men, and thus
we did not have the chance to compare the results between different age groups and gen-
ders.  The participants were also relatively young, healthy, and physically active, whichcould have influenced the results, because systematic exercise reduces body weight [
37
].
Additionally, it should be emphasized that this is an observational study and that no causal
mechanisms can be inferred.5. Conclusions
The results of the present study suggest that the
FTO
gene, when tested individually,
and all selected genes (
FTO
,
FABP2
,
LEP
,
LEPR
, and
MC4R
), when tested in gene–gene
interactions, can modify body weight and composition parameters (BMI and FMI). Weshowed that harboring the
FTO
A allele might be associated with an over two times in-
creased FMI. This observation constitutes the first important finding of the study, implyingthat harboring this specific allele is unfavorable for some individuals. The carriers of the
A allele might have an increased accumulation of body fat and a higher risk of many
obesity-related disorders. The results suggested that the
FTO
(rs9939609) polymorphism
is a candidate marker for affecting body mass and body composition parameters in theCaucasian population. From the gene–gene interaction analysis, we established the second
146

IJERPH

19
, 6030
novel finding. Namely, all five studied polymorphisms are involved in the formation ofobesity-related traits in the Caucasian population. The results imply that some individualsmight benefit from carrying some combinations of genotypes (e.g., for BMI: AT
×
AA,
TT
×
AA
,TT
×
AG; for FMI: AT
×
GG, TT
×
AA, and TT
×
AG-
FTO

, respectively),
as regards the BMI and FMI. Additionally, the gene–gene interaction analysis confirmedthat harboring the
FTO
T allele might be favorable for some individuals. This observation
confirmed that the genetic risk of obesity is connected with the accumulation of numerous
variants; thus, methods based on numerous SNPs are more informative than methods
based on a single polymorphism. Understanding the genetics of obesity can extend our
knowledge of diet individualization and exercise programs. It is crucial for the preventionof obesity-related diseases, supplementation and medical care.
