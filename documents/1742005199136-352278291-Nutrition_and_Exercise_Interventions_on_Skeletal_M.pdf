Preface
Since skeletal muscle is the main tissue of our body, comprising 40–50% of our total body mass, it
has a fundamental function in maintaining human health. Maintaining or increasing skeletal muscle
mass and its function in response to environmental stimuli (e.g.,  physical exercise and nutritional
interventions) is related to better healthy states,  while sarcopenia (decreased skeletal muscle mass
and function) is associated with poor-health conditions (e.g., physical inactivity, bad eating habits,
obesity, and related diseases). Although great advances in research of skeletal muscle plasticity have
been achieved in the last few decades, the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in
this process are still under investigation. This Special Issue contributes to our understanding and the
recent updates to these mechanisms, bringing together advanced and significant studies performed
in  the  research  field  and  focusing  on  the  modulation  of  different  dietary  nutrients,  supplements,
and  physical  exercise  training  protocols  on  skeletal  muscle  plasticity,  in  healthy  and  pathological
conditions,  including  obesity,  diabetes,  cardiovascular  diseases,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary
disease,  sarcopenia,  and aging.   The editors of this reprint are indebted to the academic/financial

Interventional strategies involving nutrition and physical exercise have been widely
proposed to positively modulate skeletal muscle function, in both physiological and patho-
logical states,  such as obesity,  T2DM, inflammatory diseases,  cardiovascular diseases,
aging, and sarcopenia [
1–3]. In this sense, it has been observed that various nutrients or
dietary bioactive compounds positively modulate different biological processes, such as
metabolism, inflammation, redox balance, mitochondrial function, and gene expression.
Several physical exercise protocols have also been proposed to maintain, increase, or re-
cover skeletal muscle function [
4–6].  Research groups are focusing potential molecular
targets to direct further studies to treat and/or prevent skeletal muscle disorders.
Moreover,  the  role  of  nutrients  associated  with  physical  exercise  in  organokines
(adipokines and myokines) responsible for metabolic health has been investigated.  For
instance, in obesity, there is an imbalance in the plasma concentration of adipokines, char-
acterized by increased pro-inflammatory adipokines (IL-6,  TNF-alpha,  leptin,  resistin,
ANGPTL2, RBB4, asprosin, chemerin, visfatin, CRP6, SPARC, WISP1, and lipocalin-2),
which has been proposed to contribute to the development of insulin resistance and de-
creased levels anti-inflammatory, anti-atherosclerotic and/or insulin sensitivity-increasing
adipokines (vaspin, omentin, adiponectin, ZAG, and SFRP5). Strategies for modulating the
levels of these adipokines can benefit cardiometabolic health and prevent obesity-related
co-morbidities [7]. Most of these adipokines are expressed in response to elevated adiposity
and a pro-inflammatory environment [8].
In the original article from Supriya et al. [9] the authors investigated the effect of spir-
ulina supplementation, a dietary supplement extracted from cyanobacteria with potential
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (Calella et al., 2022; Behairy et al., 2023), on
the adipokine/cytokine and lipid level profile in obese men submitted to a high-intensity
exercise training program for 12 weeks.  Interestingly, the association of spirulina sup-
plementation with high-intensity exercise training improved the lipid plasma profile (de-
creased cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triacylglycerides, and raised HDL-cholesterol)
and the adipokine/cytokine level profile (reduced CRP, TNF-alpha, MCP-1, IL-6, and IL-8),
suggesting that this interventional combination can be a good strategy to improve several
risk markers of metabolic and inflammatory diseases associated with obesity. The same
group [10], using a high-intensity exercise training protocol (CrossFit) for 12 weeks, also
evaluated the combined effect of astaxanthin supplementation, a dietary supplement de-
rived fromHaematoccus pluvialisalgae with several potential beneficial effects on metabolic
and inflammatory diseases, such as obesity, T2DM, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic
syndrome, and cancer [11]. This association was able to improve the adipokine level profile
concomitantly with ameliorations in body composition and lipid profile in obese male
individuals.  These results corroborate the findings of Saeidi et al. [
12] and suggest that
this interventional combination can acts as an effective therapy to decrease the deleterious
effects of obesity in metabolism and the adipokine and lipid level profile.

Various myokines have been proposed to regulate muscle function and metabolism,
including myogenesis,  mitochondrial biogenesis,  mitophagy,  autophagy,  satellite cells
activation, anti-inflammatory effect, skeletal muscle fat oxidation, and insulin response [13].
Furthermore, some myokines are hypothesized to be the mediators between myocytes and
other cells, improving glucose metabolism regulation, lipid oxidation, and cardioprotective
function [14].   In the study by Kysel et al. [15],  the authors compared two nutritional
interventions in healthy men: (1) a diet with cyclical ketogenic reduction and (2) a diet with
a nutritionally balanced decrease. During the nutritional interventions, the participants
were submitted to both aerobic and resistance exercise training protocols. The level profile
of myokines and cytokines was determined pre- and post-intervention. The administration
of a diet with a nutritionally balanced reduction increased performance in the endurance
test and raised muscle strength associated with osteonectin and musclin levels. However,
the diet with ketogenic reduction did not improve endurance performance induced by
exercise training, but it reduced the FGF-21 plasma levels. This last factor is secreted by
several tissues, such as the liver, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and pancreas, regulating
metabolism and playing an important role as a result of nutritional reduction or a ketogenic
diet [16].
In the original article from Sierra et al. [17], the authors showed the significant effect
of adequate energy, sodium, cholesterol, vitamin C, and fiber dietary consumption on
exercise-induced myokine production (myostatin, musclin, irisin, BDNF, apelin, IL-15, and
FGF-21) in endurance runners, which is important for cardiometabolic adaptations and
adequate tissue repair in response to intense physical exercise.  The myostatin pathway
was also investigated in the work performed by de Carvalho et al. [18]. In this work, the
authors determined whether creatine supplementation (monohydrate) associated with a
resistance exercise protocol was able to modulate the myostatin signaling pathway, skeletal
muscle morphology and the expression of myosin heavy chain isoforms in the soleus
muscle (red, predominantly oxidative fibers) and gastrocnemius muscle (white portion,
predominantly glycolytic fibers) of Wistar rats.  According to their theory, the authors
expected that the combination of creatine supplementation and resistance training would
promote greater changes in the white portion of the gastrocnemius muscle compared to the
soleus muscle by attenuating the expression of the myostatin. Accordingly, their findings
followed this proposition—that is, greater hypertrophy and interstitial remodeling in the
white gastrocnemius muscle than in the soleus muscle.
Valero-Breton et al. [19] evaluated the effects of two different cycling training pro-
grams (eccentric versus concentric exercise protocols) for 12 weeks in patients with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease who were demonstrated to have muscle redox imbalance
and reduced daily activities.  In this study, several redox parameters and inflammatory
biomarkers, as well as cardiometabolic assessments, were investigated. In accordance with
the findings, the authors concluded that patients submitted to the concentric exercise proto-
col presented with increased antioxidant capacity (at rest and exercise-induced), improved
insulin sensitivity, and elevated HDL levels compared to the patients who performed the
eccentric exercise protocol.
Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by decreased muscle mass and strength, re-
sulting in impaired physical performance.  Different strategies have been proposed and
analyzed with the aim to reverse the effects of sarcopenia.   Cuyul-Vásquez et al. [
20],
through a systematic review with meta-analysis, verified in older people with sarcopenia
the  effectiveness  of  resistance  exercise  training  with  or  without  whey  protein  supple-
mentation on muscle mass and strength, as well as physical performance. Despite some
limitations of the analysis, mainly related to the small effect size and the low/very low
quality of evidence from the studies performed so far, the authors concluded that resistance
exercise training is more effective in increasing skeletal muscle mass and grip strength
when associated with whey protein supplementation than when performed without any
supplementation or with placebo supplementation. The authors highlighted the relevance
of additional studies to completely comprehend this process.

In the study from Barquilha et al. [21], the authors determined the modulating effects of
fish oil supplementation, which has been proposed as having anti-inflammatory effects and
increasing skeletal muscle function [22,23], on muscle damage markers and inflammatory
cytokines after a unique hypertrophic exercise session in healthy eutrophic men trained
using a undulating/strength exercise protocol for six weeks. The authors found that the
supplementation reduced plasma indicators of muscle injury (reduced plasma CK and LDH
activity), inflammation (lowed C-reactive protein and IL-6), and redox balance (elevated
GSH:GSSG ratio). The findings of this study suggest that supplementation with fish oil can
be an important nutritional intervention for reducing muscle injury, inflammatory processes,
and oxidative stress after an intense strength exercise session, mainly in untrained and
beginner young adults with an interest in practicing resistance/strength training protocols.
The  authors  highlighted  that  further  works  are  required  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness
of this supplementation in other groups, such as trained and older people, as well as
the modulating effect of n-3 PUFAs on muscle regeneration.  In this sense, the work of
Jannas-Vela et al.  (2023) [
24] explored recent literature data about the potential effects
of this supplementation on muscle regeneration in different inflammatory conditions, in
particular, the effects of their lipid mediators, including oxylipins and endocannabinoids.
Further  works  are  required  to  determine  the  modulating  effects  of  n-3  fatty  acids  on
membrane composition and endocannabinoid and oxylipin generation, in association with
the regenerative process after muscle damage in physiological and pathological diseases.
Interestingly, in the work from Francekovi ́c and Gliemann [25], an overview was pro-
vided on the relevance of dietary nutritional compounds, including n-3 PUFA, probiotics,
and vitamin D, for endothelial glycocalyx maintenance and preservation.  The authors
proposed that these nutritional compounds are of particular importance for chronic inflam-
matory diseases, where endothelial dysfunction and vascular abnormalities are observed,
including obesity, T2DM, dyslipidemias, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases.
In summary, various groups are joining efforts to understand the molecular targets and
cellular systems implicated in the effects of nutritional interventions or different physical ex-
ercise protocols on muscle physiology, recovery, and injury in cellular, animal, and human
models. Various studies have been published and great advances have been made related
to this topic in recent decades. The present Special Issue has further contributed to the ad-
vanced comprehension of the molecular targets and cellular systems implicated in skeletal
muscle physiology, injury, and recovery in physiological and pathological conditions.

Abstract:Adiposity, a state characterized by excessive accumulation of body fat, is closely linked to
metabolic complications and the secretion of specific adipokines. This study explores the potential
of exercise and Spirulina supplementation to mitigate these complications and modulate adipokine
release associated with obesity.  The primary objective of this investigation was to examine the
impact of a 12-week regimen of high-intensity training combined with Spirulina supplementation
on adipokine concentrations and lipid profiles in male individuals with obesity (N = 44). The par-
ticipants were randomly distributed into four groups, each consisting of 11 participants: a control
group (CG), a supplement group (SG), a training group (TG), and a training plus supplement group
(TSG). The intervention comprised a 12-week treatment involving Spirulina supplementation (6 g
capsule daily), a 12-week high-intensity interval training (HIIT) protocol with three sessions per
week, or a combined approach. Following the interventions, metabolic parameters, anthropometric
measurements, cardiorespiratory indices, and circulating adipokines [CRP, Sema3C, TNF-α, IL-6,
MCP1, IL-8] were assessed within 48 h of the before and final training session. Statistical analyses
revealed significant differences across all measures among the groups (p< 0.05). Notably, post hoc
analyses indicated substantial disparities between the CG and the three interventional groups regard-
ing body weight (p< 0.05). The combined training and supplementation approach led to noteworthy
reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TGL) levels
(allp< 0.0001), coupled with an elevation in high-density lipoprotein–cholesterol (HDL-C) levels
(p= 0.0001). Furthermore, adipokine levels significantly declined in the three intervention groups
relative to the CG (p< 0.05). The findings from this 12-week study demonstrate that Spirulina supple-
mentation in conjunction with high-intensity interval training reduced adipokine levels, improved

Spirulina supplementation and high-intensity interval training as a synergistic strategy to ameliorate
obesity-related complications and enhance overall cardiometabolic well-being in obese males.

1. Introduction
Obesity exerts detrimental effects on a multitude of physiological systems by impairing
the proper functioning of tissues and organs, thereby contributing to the onset of various
diseases. It stands as a prominent risk factor for numerous noncommunicable disorders,
including type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular ailments, hypertension, stroke, diverse
forms of cancer, and mental health concerns [
1].  Key factors in the genesis of obesity
and its associated disorders, such as insulin resistance and T2D, encompass alterations in
the levels of circulating adipokines and cytokines [2,3].  Adipokines represent bioactive
molecules discharged into the bloodstream from adipose tissue, orchestrating metabolic
changes in a manner that affects a wide array of tissues and organs [4]. Similarly, cytokines,
predominantly released by white blood cells, wield systemic and localized influences [4].
In the context of obesity, inflammatory adipokines and cytokines often display heightened
levels  and  have  been  implicated  in  the  pathogenesis  of  various  disease  processes  [1].
Prominent among the elevated obesity-associated circulating adipokines and cytokines are
the C-reactive protein (CRP) [5,6], Semaphorin-3C (Sema3C), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha
(TNF alpha), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) [
7], Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP1) [7], and
Interleukin-8 (IL-8) [8].
Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in mediating the escalation of adipokine-induced
inflammation, with reactive oxygen species (ROS) increasing as visceral fat expands during
the progression of obesity, thus modifying the expression and secretion of inflammatory
adipokines [3,5].  ROS generation can stem from oxidative phosphorylation within the
mitochondria, and the extent of production is contingent on mitochondrial function [
6].
In physiological circumstances, antioxidant buffering balances ROS production.  How-
ever, in situations of overnutrition and obesity, ROS production may surpass the capacity
of antioxidant buffering, culminating in oxidative stress wherein ROS disrupts cellular
and tissue function, including the activation of pathways that augment adipokine and
cytokine expression [3,6]. Notably, ROS plays a crucial role in developing obesity-linked
cardiometabolic disorders [6].
Consequently, a growing interest has been in mitigating ROS levels in obesity. Several
investigations have illustrated that dietary antioxidants, counteracting the pro-oxidative
state of cells, might hold therapeutic potential for addressing obesity and its concomitant
comorbidities [9]. Exogenous dietary antioxidants synergize with endogenous counterparts
to bolster cellular antioxidant capacity [10]. Spirulina, an ancient cyanobacterium and one
of the earliest life forms on Earth, boasts antioxidant attributes.  Evidence underscores
Spirulina’s potential to reduce blood lipid levels, body fat, waist circumference, body mass
index, and appetite [11–13]. Nonetheless, the impact of Spirulina on oxidative stress and
inflammation markers in humans remains a subject of debate [14,15].
Furthermore, the interplay between Spirulina supplementation and exercise, known
to alleviate oxidative stress and inflammation markers, remains unclear [16,17]. Although
acute exercise initially elevates ROS, regular exercise activates the endogenous antioxidant
system, affording protection against oxidative damage [17,18]. A reduction in ROS levels
could potentially modulate the altered profiles of adipokines and cytokines witnessed
in obesity [
17].  Notably, Spirulina supplementation has been shown to enhance acute
exercise performance, fat oxidation, and glutathione levels while attenuating the rise in lipid
peroxidation prompted by aerobic exercise [
19–21]. In a particular study, the combination of
High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) and Spirulina supplementation positively impacted
6

Nutrients2023,15, 4891
immunoglobulin levels, cardiorespiratory fitness, and body composition in overweight and
obese women, along with an increase in immunoglobulin A (IgA), vital for the immune
system [19]. Prior research has also examined Spirulina’s influence on nesfatin-1, omentin-1,
and lipid profiles among obese and overweight females [22]. The combination of Spirulina
and HIIT elevated nesfatin-1 and omentin-1 levels, although Spirulina supplementation
alone did not [
22]. Another study scrutinized the independent and synergistic effects of
Spirulina supplementation (4.5 g per day), with or without engagement in aerobic exercise
three days per week and HIIT two days per week, on blood lipids and body mass index
(BMI) in 52 sedentary men with excess body weight over six weeks [
23].  The findings
demonstrated that Spirulina supplementation potentiated the hypolipidemic effects of an
intensive physical training regimen in males with excess body weight and dyslipidemia [23].
In past studies, it has been shown that Spirulina alone causes weight loss [13,24], and on
the other hand, the combination of Spirulina consumption with exercise training reduces
inflammatory indicators in obese people [25].
However, despite these observations pointing toward favorable impacts of Spirulina
and HIIT on cardiometabolic health markers among individuals with obesity, alterations in
adipokines during such interventions have yet to be investigated.
Consequently, the present study aims to explore the effects of a 12-week regimen
combining HIIT and Spirulina supplementation on markers of cardiometabolic health,
anthropometric measures, cardiorespiratory fitness, as well as adipokines and cytokines, in
comparison to the effects of HIIT and Spirulina interventions in isolation. It is postulated
that the combined intervention will yield more pronounced improvements in the measured
variables compared to each intervention alone.
2. Methods
2.1. Ethical Approval
The research received approval from the Ethics Committee of the Sport Sciences
Research Institute (Ethics code: IR.SSRC.REC.1401.093). All protocols adhered to the most
recent iteration of the Declaration of Helsinki [19].
2.2. Participants
Following outreach in public spaces, laboratories, sports clubs, and social networks,
143 adult men volunteered to partake in the current research. Among them, 80 participants
were  eligible  for  the  study  entry  criteria.   Inclusion  criteria:  having  a  BMI  exceeding
30 kg/m
2
, lacking involvement in regular physical activities over the past six months,
having no history of cardiovascular or endocrine disorders, and no smoking and alcohol
consumption. Prospective participants with joint ailments, physical disabilities, and those
utilizing prescription medications or supplements with potential impacts on muscle and
adipose tissue metabolism were excluded from the study.
A subset of 80 individuals was ultimately chosen to participate after thoroughly
evaluating the volunteers. The inclusion criteria necessitated that all participants undergo
a comprehensive physical examination conducted by a qualified medical professional
and clinical exercise physiologist during the initial visit. After the initial evaluation and
explanation of different parts of the research, 64 individuals were selected. The sample size
was based on the standardized effect size (SES) calculated using the mean and standard
deviation values of similar studies reported in the literature [26]. The standardized effect
size was placed in the G*Power (3.1.9.4) analysis program [two-sided,α= 0.05, power
(1-β) = 0.95, effect size = 1.43]. Accordingly, the minimum sample number per group was
determined to be nine.  In the present study, we considered 16 subjects for each group.
Additionally, participants were required to furnish a signed consent form and complete the
Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) [11]. This process ensured adherence
to established research standards and ethical guidelines.

2.3. Experimental Design
Participants underwent a familiarization session during which all study procedures
were comprehensively elucidated, taking place one week before the initiation of the training
regimens. Measurements of height and body mass were conducted for each participant.
Subsequently, participants were assigned at random to one of four equitably sized groups
(16 participants in each group): the Control Group (CG), the Supplement Group (SG), the
Training Group (TG), and the Training + Supplement Group (TSG) Figure 1.

Figure 1.Flow of participant recruitment.
Throughout the study duration,  20 participants withdrew from the study due to
medical conditions, work-related challenges, and a lack of sustained interest in the research.
As a result, each group had 11 participants remaining for the subsequent analysis. Detailed
instructions regarding the execution of training protocols were given to each group during
the third session, coinciding with measurements of body mass and VO
2peak
.
8

Nutrients2023,15, 4891
Following the baseline measurements, the two groups engaged in training (TG and TSG)
embarked on a 12-week exercise program involving three sessions per week.  Participants
allocated to all groups were instructed to maintain their lifestyles throughout the study. All
measurements were conducted at consistent times of day (with a deviation of approximately
1 h) and under uniform environmental conditions (~20
◦
C and ~55% humidity).
Baseline assessments were conducted 48 h before the commencement of the training
protocols,  while  post-tests  occurred  48  h  after  the  final  session  for  all  groups.   Those
participating in the training protocols were instructed to adhere to the same dietary regimen
for 48 h before the baseline assessment and the concluding measurements.
2.4. Anthropometric and Cardio-Respiratory Fitness Assessments
The measurement of participants’ body mass and height was carried out using a cali-
brated scale (Seca, Halmburger, Germany) for weight and a stadiometer (Seca, Halmburger,
Germany) for height.  These measurements were subsequently utilized to calculate the
participants’ body mass index (BMI) in kilograms per square meter (kg/m
2
). The assess-
ment of VO
2peak
was conducted employing a modified Bruce protocol within a controlled
environment set at a temperature range of 21–23
◦
C. This protocol has been previously
documented in studies involving individuals with overweight and obesity [
11,12].  The
exercise was performed on a motorized treadmill (H/P/Cosmos, Pulsar med 3p-Sports
and Medical, Nussdorf-Traunstein, Germany).
The determination of VO
2peak
adhered to the physiological criteria outlined by the
American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines. These criteria included reaching
a point of perceived physical exhaustion and maximal effort, as indicated by participants’
responses on the Borg scale, or the identification of severe dyspnea, dizziness, and other
constraining  symptoms  by  the  supervisor,  following  the  ACSM  and  American  Heart
Association (AHA) guidelines for cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) [
27,28].  A
plateau in both VO
2
and respiratory exchange ratio (RER)≥1.10 was used to confirm
VO
2peak
attainment.
Blood pressure readings were obtained using an electronic sphygmomanometer (Kenz
BPM AM 300P CE, Nagoya, Japan), and heart rate was continuously monitored throughout
the tests using a Polar V800 heart monitor (Finland). Gas analysis was carried out using a
gas analyzer system (Metalyzer 3B analyzer, Cortex: biophysics, GmbH, Leipzig, Germany),
which underwent calibration before each testing session.
2.5. Training Protocols
VO
2peak
values were used to prescribe exercise intensity in training sessions, which
consisted of treadmill running for 32 min. Prior to each training session, subjects performed
5 min of warm-up activities (stretching movements, walking, and running).  In the first
week, subjects ran on a treadmill at 65% of VO
2peak
and in the second week at 75% of
VO
2peak
for 32 min and three sessions a week.  In week three, the HIIT sessions began.
In the third and fourth weeks, subjects performed intervals of 4 min of running at 75%
VO
2peak
followed by 4 min of inactive recovery for 32 min. In weeks 5, 6, and 7, subjects
performed intervals of 4 min at 85% of VO
2peak
with 4 min active recovery intervals at
15% of VO
2peak
32 min. In weeks 8, 9, and 10, subjects performed 4 min intervals at 90%
VO
2peak
with active recovery intervals at 30% VO
2peak
for 4 min on the treadmill for 32 min.
In weeks 11 and 12, subjects completed 4 min intervals at 95% VO
2peak
with 4 min active
rest intervals at 50% VO
2peak
for 32 min.  After completing the training in each session,
subjects performed a 5 min cool-down at 50% VO
2peak
in each session [29].  The control
group continued their normal daily activities and were restricted from participating in
regular physical activity.
2.6. Supplementation of Spirulina and Placebo
Spirulina samples (Hellenic Spirulina Net: Production unit: Thermopigi, Sidorokastro,
Serres, Greece) were encapsulated for administration.  Each subject ingested a total of
9

Nutrients2023,15, 4891
6 g daily, divided into two doses of 3 g each, one in the morning and the other in the
evening,  over 12 weeks [
30].   Comparable amounts of placebo were also provided to
both the Control Group (CG) and Treatment Group (TG). The placebo was formulated
using corn starch, tinted with a food-grade green coloring resembling Spirulina powder,
and enhanced with the essence of kiwi fruit for flavor.  Corn starch, a neutral and inert
substance lacking therapeutic properties, was selected for its established safety profile.
Widely employed across the culinary and pharmaceutical sectors, it is recognized as a
colorless, tasteless, secure, non-toxic, non-irritating, and hypoallergenic powder. Adherence
to the supplementation regimen was defined as consumption of =80% of the assigned
supplements by each participant.
2.7. Nutrient Intake and Dietary Analysis
Three-day food records (two weekdays and one weekend day) were obtained before
and after the study to assess changes in habitual dietary intake over time [31]. Each food
item was individually entered into Diet Analysis Plus version 10 (Cengage, Boston, MA,
USA), and total energy consumption and the amount of energy derived from proteins, fats,
and carbohydrates were determined (Table 1).

2.9. Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics (means±standard deviation) were used to describe all data.
The normality of the data was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test. A two-way ANOVA
repeated measures test was used to determine the Group×time interaction.  One-way
ANOVA and Fisher LSD post hoc tests were used for the evaluation baseline data of four
groups.   When a significant difference was detected using ANOVA, mean differences
were determined using pairwise comparisons. The sample size was calculated to detect
a statistical difference between study variables with a 95% confidence interval (CI) equal
to or greater than 80% of the power value.  Additionally, effect sizes (ES) were reported
as partial eta-squared. In accordance with Hopkins et al. (2009) [32], ES were considered
trivial (<0.2), small (0.2–0.6), moderate (0.6–1.2), large (1.2–2.0), and very large (2.0–4.0). A
p-value of <0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance. All data were evaluated with
SPSS software (version 24).
3. Results
3.1. Anthropometry and VO
2peak
The four groups’ baseline differences were insignificant for body mass (p= 0.46) and
BMI (p= 0.46). Body mass was significantly different from baseline in the TSG (p= 0.039);
however, it was not in the SG (p= 0.72), TG (p= 0.12), or CG group (p= 0.70) (Table 1). BMI

(
p= 0.94),  TC (p= 0.72),  and TG (p= 0.92).   Compared to the baseline,  HDL was sig-
nificantly increased in the SG (p= 0.0001), TG (p= 0.0001), and TSG (p= 0.0001) but not
11

Nutrients2023,15, 4891
in the CG (p= 0.07).  The time×group interaction was significant for HDL (p= 0.0001,
η
2
= 0.65).   The results of the Bonferroni test showed significant differences in the TG
(
p= 0.044) and TSG (p= 0.0001) compared to the CG but no difference between the SG
(p= 0.09) and CG. Also, the changes in HDL in the TSG were significantly higher compared
to the SG (p= 0.0001) and TG (p= 0.0001), but the differences between the SG and TG were
not significant (p= 0.99) (Table 2).
Post-test values for LDL were significantly lower in the SG (p= 0.005), TG (p= 0.0001),
and TSG (p= 0.0001) but not in the CG (p= 0.82) compared to baseline.  The interaction
between time and groups was significant for LDL (p= 0.0001,
η
2
= 0.63).  Post hoc tests
revealed that the reduction in LDL was significantly greater in the TG (p= 0.0001) and
TSG (p= 0.0001) compared to the CG; however, it was not different between the SG and
CG (
p= 0.34).  The reductions in LDL in the TG (p= 0.032) and TSG (p= 0.0001) were
significantly greater compared to the SG, while the TSG was not different compared to the
TG (p= 0.066) (Table 2).
Compared  to  the  baseline,  there  were  decreases  in  TC  in  the  SG  (p=  0.009),  TG
(
p= 0.001),  and  TSG  (p=  0.0001)  following  the  12-week  intervention.   There  were  no
significant changes in TC at 12 weeks in the CG (p= 0.19). There was a significant interaction
between time and groups for TC (p= 0.0001,
η
2
= 0.36). Results of the Bonferroni test showed
that after 12 weeks, compared to the CG, TC was significantly lower in the SG (p= 0.039),
TG (p= 0.002), and TSG (p= 0.001). There were no significant differences in TC at 12 weeks
between the SG, TG, and TSG groups (p= 0.99) (Table 2).
Compared to baseline, TGL at 12 weeks was significantly lower in the SG (p= 0.006),
TG (p= 0.0001), and TSG (p= 0.0001).  There was a significant interaction between time
and groups for TGL (p= 0.0001,η
2
= 0.46). Results of the Bonferroni test showed that after
12 weeks, TGL was significantly lower in the TG (p= 0.003) and TSG (p= 0.001) compared
to the CG. However, the SG was not significantly lower compared to the CG (p= 0.99). The
reductions in TGL after 12 weeks were more significant in the TSG compared to the SG
(p= 0.001) but not compared to TG (p= 0.99) (Table 2).
3.3. Adipokines and Cytokines
There were no significant differences between the groups in baseline values for CRP
(p= 0.62), Sema3C (p= 0.68), TNF-α(p= 0.26), IL-6 (p= 0.50), MCP1 (p= 0.74), and IL-8
(
p= 0.78).  Compared to baseline, CRP was lower in the SG (p= 0.0001), TG (p= 0.0001),
and TSG (p= 0.0001) but not in the CG (p= 0.72) after 12 weeks. There was a significant
time×group interaction for CRP (p= 0.0001,η
2
= 0.42). Post hoc test results showed that
after 12 weeks, the CRP was lower in the SG (p= 0.002), TG (p= 0.001), and TSG (p= 0.0001)
compared to the CG. CRP levels in the TSG were lower compared to the SG (p= 0.99)
and TG (p= 0.99).  CRP levels at 12 weeks were not different between the TG and SG
(p= 0.99) (Figure 2). Sema3C at 12 weeks was significantly lower in the SG (p= 0.0001), TG
(p= 0.0001), and TSG (p= 0.0001) compared to the baseline. There was no difference in the
CG (p= 0.37) at 12 weeks compared to the baseline. Also, the time×groups interaction for
Sema3C was significant (p= 0.0001,η
2
= 0.40). The results of the Bonferroni test showed that
after 12 weeks, compared to the CG, Sema3C was lower in the SG (p= 0.001), TG (
p= 0.003),
and TSG (p= 0.0001). However, there were no differences in Sema3C between the SG, TG,
and TSG groups (p= 0.99) (Figure 3). Following the 12-week intervention, TNF-αwas not
different in the CG compared to the baseline (p= 0.17).  However, TNF-αwas lower in
the SG (p= 0.0001), TG (T = 0.0001), and TSG (p= 0.0001) compared to the baseline. The
interaction between time and groups was also significant for TNF-α(p= 0.0001,η
2
= 0.52).
The results of the Bonferroni revealed that at 12 weeks, TNF-αwas significantly lower in
the TG (p= 0.0001) and TSG (p= 0.0001) compared to the CG. There was no difference
between the SG and CG (p= 0.057). Compared to the SG, TNF-αwas significantly lower
in the TG (p= 0.030); however, TNF-αlevels in the TSG were not different from the SG
(
p= 0.057) and TG (p= 0.99) (Figure 4). Compared to the baseline, IL-6 was not different
intheCG(p= 0.46) at 12 weeks, while concentrations were lower in the SG (p= 0.008),
12

Nutrients2023,15, 4891
TG (p= 0.0001), and TSG (p= 0.0001). The time×groups interaction was also significant
for IL-6 (p= 0.0001,η
2
= 0.38). IL-6 was significantly lower in the TG (p= 0.004) and TSG
(p= 0.0001) compared to the CG but not in the SG (p= 0.096). The reduction in IL-6 in the
TSG was not different compared to the TG (p= 0.99) and SG (p= 0.19), while there was
also no difference between the SG and TG (p= 0.99) (Figure 5). Compared to the baseline,
MCP-1 at 12 weeks was significantly increased in the CG (p= 0.46), while MCP-1 was
decreased in the SG (p= 0.0001), TG (p= 0.0001), and TSG (p= 0.0001). Also, a significant
interaction between time and groups was observed for MCP-1 (p= 0.0001,η
2
= 0.44). The
results of the Bonferroni post hoc test showed that compared to the CG, MCP-1 was lower
in the SG (p= 0.001), TG (p= 0.0001), and TSG (p= 0.001).  There were no differences in
MCP-1 between the SG, TG, and TSG groups (p= 0.99) (Figure 6). IL-8 concentrations at
12 weeks were significantly lower in the TG (p= 0.0001) and TSG (p= 0.0001) but were not
different in the SG (p= 0.06) or CG (p= 0.50). Also, a significant interaction between time
and groups was reported for IL-8 (p= 0.003,η
2
= 0.30). The results of the Bonferroni test
showed that IL-8 was significantly lower in the TG (p= 0.005) and TSG (p= 0.01) compared
to the CG but not in the SG (p= 0.46). There were no significant differences at 12 weeks
between the SG, TG, and TSG groups (p> 0.05) (Figure 7).

4. Discussion
This study demonstrated that 12 weeks of HIIT and Spirulina supplementation, sepa-
rately and in combination, can improve circulating adipokines levels in obese men. The
combination of HIIT and Spirulina supplementation overall led to greater changes in
measured outcomes compared to each intervention alone.  In this study, it was shown
that HIIT and Spirulina supplementation decreased plasma levels of IL-8, IL-6, MCP-1,
Semaphorin3c, CRP, LDL, TC, TGL, and TNF-αand increased HDL. We also showed that
HIIT and Spirulina supplementation increases VO
2peak
and decreases BMI.
Metabolic syndrome and other cardiovascular risk factors are strongly correlated
with excess body fat [
27].  As a result, global healthcare systems annually support new
programs to reduce obesity and other cardiovascular hazards [
28].  This study provides
evidence for the beneficial effects of Spirulina supplementation (6 g/day) and 32 min of
HIIT three times per week for 12 weeks on improving anthropometric measurements,
cardiometabolic risk factors (TC, LDL, HDL, and TGL), and reducing pro-inflammatory
adipokines (CRP, TNF-α, Sema-3C, IL-8, IL-6, and MCP-1) with the combination of HIIT
and Spirulina improving cardiometabolic health makers greater than HIIT or Spirulina
supplementation individually.
4.1. Favorable Modulations of Metabolic Factors and Cardiorespiratory Parameters
We found that 12 weeks of HIIT and Spirulina supplementation resulted in numerous
improved markers of metabolic health.  The most significant improvements came when
training and supplementation were combined compared to the control group. Cardiores-
piratory fitness is strongly related to cardiometabolic health and all-cause mortality [33].
Here, we show that HIIT increased VO
2peak
; however, the addition of Spirulina did not
further increase VO
2peak
compared to HIIT alone. The current literature on aerobic exercise
performance and Spirulina supplementation is equivocal, with some evidence indicating it
may possess an ergogenic effect while other evidence suggests it does not [34].
Similarly, blood lipid profiles were improved in all intervention groups; however, the
most considerable improvement occurred in TSG vs. TG and SG. Reductions in TC, LDL,
and TGL occurred with training and supplementation alone and to a greater degree when
combined, while an increase in HDL was observed. While there are data demonstrating
lipid-lowering effects of Spirulina supplementation [35] as well as a plethora of literature
evidencing the effects of regular exercise, including HIIT on blood lipids in obesity [36],
only one study, to our knowledge, has demonstrated a hypolipidemic impact of combined
exercise with HIIT and Spirulina supplementation in obese male individuals [23]. Fifty-two
15

Nutrients2023,15, 4891
inactive males with extra body weight participated in the study, and the researchers looked
at the individual and combined effects of Spirulina supplementation (4.5 g/day) with or
without physical activity (3 days/week) and HIIT (2 days/week). Similar to our findings,
they reported increased HDL levels while TC, TG, and LDL levels decreased [23].  This
indicates that when a Spirulina supplement is added with HIIT, it can positively impact
cardiometabolic factors, which were affected to a lesser degree when supplementation and
HIIT were undertaken alone.
The glycemic effects of Spirulina may stem from the presence of fibers, which lowers
glucose absorption from the gut [37]. Additionally, phycocyanin, an antioxidant in Spir-
ulina, has enhanced insulin sensitivity through Akt and AMPK signaling [
38].  Exercise
is well known to facilitate increased insulin sensitivity and glucose regulation through
AMPK signaling, leading to an increased expression of GLUT4 and insulin signaling-related
proteins [39–41].  It is interesting to speculate whether the robust effects on glycemia of
combining Spirulina supplementation with HIIT may have been mediated by augmented
AMPK activity.
The hypocholesterolemic effect of Spirulina may partly be attributed to its g-linolenic
acid (GLA) concentration,  which is found in Spirulina as it may reduce hepatic lipid
accumulation [
37,42,43].  Moreover, phycocyanin likely plays a role in improving lipid
profiles in that phycocyanin has been shown to reduce intestinal cholesterol absorption
and increase lipoprotein lipase (LPL) that is involved in LDL hydrolysis and subsequently
reduce LDL levels [44].  While the underlying mechanisms of lipid-improving effects of
exercise are still unclear, increased activation of LPL and reverse cholesterol transport are
likely involved, which reduce LDL and increase HDL, respectively. Combined, Spirulina
supplementation and HIIT appear to have synergistic effects on glycemic function and
blood lipids, producing more significant improvements than when completed alone.
4.2. Favorable Modulations of Adipokines
To the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the effects of HIIT and
Spirulina supplementation on adipokines and cytokines in obesity. We found that Spirulina
supplementation and HIIT alone and in combination improve markers of inflammation,
with the involvement of HIIT (TSG and TG) producing greater improvements in some
markers. For example, we found that circulating CRP was reduced with HIIT and Spirulina
supplementation with lower TSG concentrations than TG and SG. We also showed that
compared to CG, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-αwere lower in TSG and TG but not SG. For Sema3C
and MCP1,  HIIT and Spirulina reduced circulating concentrations with no significant
differences between SG, TG, and TSG.
Chronic inflammation is a central element in the pathogenesis of systemic cardiometabolic
dysfunction that occurs in obesity, including insulin resistance [45,46].  Involved in this
process is the secretion of adipokines from adipose tissue and cytokines from immune
cells. In non-obese conditions, adipose tissue secretes anti-inflammatory adipokines such
as adiponectin; however, in obesity, pro-inflammatory macrophages accumulate, and the
adipokine secretory profile transitions to pro-inflammatory [46]. Evidence suggests that
this shift in the adipokine secretory profile, in part, results from increases in ROS from
mitochondrial dysfunction as well as the infiltration of pro-inflammatory macrophages
occurring in obesity [4,47,48]. Therefore, treatments aimed at alleviating oxidative stress
and subsequent chronic inflammation represent worthwhile investigation. We showed that
12 weeks of HIIT and Spirulina supplementation improved several markers of adipocy-
tokines and were associated with improved cardiometabolic health markers. While this
study did not measure ROS or antioxidant capacity, we hypothesize that improvements
in oxidative stress are likely involved in the positive alterations in adipo- and cytokines
observed following HIIT and Spirulina supplementation. Though acute exercise increases
ROS, regular exercise leads to greater resistance against oxidative damage through in-
creased antioxidant capacity [49]. Similarly, Spirulina exerts antioxidant properties and has
been shown to increase total antioxidant status in obese males [35]. Both exercise and Spir-
16

Nutrients2023,15, 4891
ulina have also been shown to improve inflammatory status, including when performed
together [16,22,35]. Four weeks of Spirulina supplementation of 500 mg/d combined with
HIIT increased anti-inflammatory nesfatin-1 and omentin-1 to a greater degree than HIIT
alone in overweight and obese women [22].
We hypothesized that the combination of HIIT and Spirulina supplementation would
promote improvements in adipocytokines to a greater degree than either alone; however,
except for CRP, we found that TSG did not produce greater changes in inflammatory
markers compared to TG and SG. This is interesting as TSG produced greater improvements
in numerous metabolic and anthropometric markers compared to TG and SG. This indicates
that either 12 weeks of HIIT or Spirulina alone is sufficient to lead to positive changes in
systemic inflammation; however, the combination of HIIT and Spirulina provides additional
clinical  benefits.   Given  this,  HIIT  and  Spirulina  supplementation  appear  to  promote
positive  metabolic  health  outcomes  that  may  not  be  mediated  through  inflammatory
signaling, such as ATK-AMPK signaling, as mentioned earlier.  Reductions in FAT were
similar in TSG, TG, and SG, which may explain the similar alterations in adipocytokines
as adiposity status influences inflammatory status in obesity.  For example, weight loss
reduces pro-inflammatory macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue, reducing systemic
inflammation [50].
5. Study Limitations
There are various limitations inherent in our investigation.  Initially, the processes
behind the potential enhancement of adipokine levels by bioactive constituents of Spirolina
were not determined. Furthermore, the generalizability of our research is limited due to the
exclusion of females in the enrollment of patients. Another limitation of our study is the
lack of measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, fat percentage, and MET for the subjects
of the present study.
6. Conclusions
This study demonstrated that supplementation of the antioxidant Spirulina and HIIT
improves anthropometrics, cardiometabolic health markers, and adipocytokine profiles in
obese males. Moreover, we showed that while HIIT and Spirulina alone resulted in similar
changes in markers of inflammation, the combination of HIIT and Spirulina led to more
significant improvements in cardiometabolic health outcomes. This suggests that while
HIIT and Spirulina alone can foster improved inflammation in obesity, the combination
of both leads to additional beneficial clinical outcomes that appear to be mediated by
mechanisms beyond the modulation of obesity-related inflammation.

Abstract:
Regular physical activity and the use of nutritional supplements, including antioxidants,
are recognized as efficacious approaches for the prevention and mitigation of obesity-related compli-
cations. This study investigated the effects of 12 weeks of CrossFit training combined with astaxanthin
(ASX) supplementation on some plasma adipokines in males with obesity. Sixty-eight males with
obesity (BMI: 33.6±1.4 kg·m
−2
) were randomly assigned into four groups: the control group (CG;
n= 11), ASX supplementation group (SG;n= 11), CrossFit group (TG;n= 11), and training plus
supplement group (TSG;n= 11). Participants underwent 12 weeks of supplementation with ASX or
placebo (20 mg/day capsule daily), CrossFit training, or a combination of both interventions. Plasma
levels of semaphorin 3C (SEMA3C), apelin, chemerin, omentin1, visfatin, resistin, adiponectin, leptin,
vaspin, and RBP4 were measured 72 h before the first training session and after the last training
session. The plasma levels of all measured adipokines were significantly altered in SG, TG, and TSG
groups (p< 0.05). The reduction of resistin was significantly higher in TSG than in SG (p< 0.05). The
plasma levels of omentin1 were significantly higher in both training groups of TG and TSG than SG
(p< 0.05), although such a meaningful difference was not observed between both training groups
(p> 0.05). Significant differences were found in the reductions of plasma levels of vaspin, visfatin,
apelin, RBP4, chemerin, and SEMA3C between the SG and TSG groups (p< 0.05). The study found
that a 12-week intervention using ASX supplementation and CrossFit exercises resulted in significant
improvements in several adipokines among male individuals with obesity. Notably, the combined

approach of supplementation and training had the most pronounced results. The findings presented
in this study indicate that the supplementation of ASX and participation in CrossFit exercise have the
potential to be effective therapies in mitigating complications associated with obesity and enhancing
metabolic health.

1. Introduction
Obesity is characterized by an excessive accumulation of adipose tissue and is strongly
linked to the development and progression of several metabolic disorders [1,2]. Accumu-
lated adipose tissue not only acts as a reservoir for excess energy, but also functions as
an endocrine organ that releases molecular proteins known as adipokines [1,3]. Of these
adipokines, leptin, resistin, visfatin, apelin, retinol binding protein4 (RBP4), vaspin, and
chemerin are associated with obesity, while others such as adiponectin and omentin1 have
a negative correlation. These adipokines are involved in various physiological processes
such as metabolism and glucose homeostasis, oxidative stress, and the pathophysiology of
obesity [4–6]. Leptin exerts its effects on hunger reduction and the restoration of energy
balance by acting on central processes, namely by blocking certain leptin-sensitive neu-
rons such as neuropeptide Y and proopiomelanocortin neurons, hence promoting energy
homeostasis [7,8].
Engaging in regular physical activity is a potent strategy for enhancing general well-
being, preventing and decreasing obesity, and alleviating the adverse health consequences
linked to excessive adipose tissue [5,9].   CrossFit is an exercise regimen characterized
by the use of diverse functional movements derived from several athletic disciplines,
including weightlifting, gymnastics, and powerlifting. These movements are performed
in rigorous sessions that emphasize high-intensity training [10].  Previous studies have
confirmed the positive effects of CrossFit training on physiological and fitness factors
(e.g., body composition, cardiovascular/respiratory fitness, strength, flexibility, power, and
balance) [11,12].
At the present time, data are insufficient on the impact of CrossFit training on the
adipokines that are the subject of investigation in the current study. However, literature
exists on other modes of training for various adipokines [
5,13–17]. For example, jogging
and step aerobic exercise increased leptin and interleukin-15 (IL-15) while decreasing
resistin in overweight women [18]. Jung et al. [15] indicated a significant decrease in blood
leptin levels after 12 weeks of engaging in moderate-intensity exercise—namely brisk
walking—among both obese men and females.  Ouerghi et al. [
19] showed that plasma
levels of omentin-1 increased after 8 weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in obese
participants, along with reduced obesity, blood lipids, and insulin sensitivity. However,
others have found no significant changes in omentin-1 after a training period [20,21].
Antioxidant supplementation can be used to attenuate the negative effects of oxidative
stress [22]. Astaxanthin (3,3

-dihydroxy-B, B-carotene4, 4

-dione), which is derived from
Haematoccus pluvialisalgae, has been shown to reduce the effects of oxidative stress on lipid
metabolism [23]. Systematic review and meta-analysis studies revealed that Astaxanthin
(ASX) supplementation was associated with a decrease in insulin resistance and oxida-
tive stress, an increase in antioxidant capacity and mitochondrial biogenesis in obesity,
as well as improvements regarding diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative
disorders, chronic inflammatory disease, and some cancers [
24,25]. Furthermore, it also
improves lipid metabolism [23,26,27]. Moreover, ASX supplementation improves insulin
resistance in obese mice by modulating insulin signaling and activating mitochondrial en-
ergy metabolism via pathways for AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptorγcoactivator1a (Pgc1a) in skeletal muscles [28]. Although
there is less available evidence about the precise mechanism by which ASX supplementa-
22

Nutrients2023,15, 4803
tion acts, it is postulated that the favorable effects of ASX may be attributed to its impact on
the secretion of adipokines, akin to other bioactive chemicals such as capsaicin. Although
a recent review study found that combined ASX supplementation and exercise did not
improve exercise performance [29], it is unknown whether a combination of ASX supple-
mentation and exercise produces beneficial effects on metabolic health in obese individuals.
Furthermore, the effects of ASX supplementation on adipokines in the present study are
currently unclear [29]. We have previously found that ASX supplementation and CrossFit
training improved body composition, metabolic profiles, anthropometric measurements,
cardio-respiratory function, and some adipokines (i.e., Cq1/TNF-related protein 9 and
2 [CTRP9 and 2] and growth differentiation factor 8 and 15 [GDF8
and 15]) [30], but the
effect of CrossFit training on other adipokines (semaphorin 3C (SEMA3C), apelin, chemerin,
omentin1, visfatin, resistin, adiponectin, leptin, vaspin, and RBP4) is unexplored. On the
other hand, the current study hypothesized that CrossFit training and ASX supplemen-
tation has a positive effect on SEMA3C, apelin,  chemerin,  omentin1,  visfatin,  resistin,
adiponectin, leptin, vaspin, and RBP4 in males with obesity. Therefore, this study aimed to
investigate the effect of 12 weeks of CrossFit training combined with ASX supplementation
on SEMA3C, apelin, chemerin, omentin1, visfatin, resistin, adiponectin, leptin, vaspin, and
RBP4 in males with obesity.
2. Methods
Participant recruitment has been described previously (see [30]).  Study inclusion
criteria were body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg·m
−2
, lack of regular physical exercise in the
last six months, absence of cardiovascular, metabolic, or endocrine disorders, and no alcohol
intake. The research excluded individuals who had joint disorders, physical limitations,
or were using prescription drugs and supplements that might potentially impact muscle
and  adipose  tissue  metabolism  [31].   The  participants  were  originally  presented  with
a thorough explanation of the research protocols.  Subsequently, all participants had a
medical examination conducted by a physician and clinical exercise physiologist on their
first visit. Additionally, they were required to sign a written consent form and the Physical
Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PARQ) [32]. The study was approved by the National
Research and Ethics Committee (Ethics code: IR.IAU.DAMGHAN.REC.1401.035) and the
Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCTID: IRCT20151228025732N76). The procedures were
conducted in accordance with the most recent version of the Declaration of Helsinki [33].
2.1. Experimental Design
Participants were familiarized with the entire study procedure one week prior to
the initiation of the main training protocol.  Basic measures including height and body
weight were assessed (see [
30]).  Then, 68 eligible participants (age:  27±8 yrs.; height:
167.8
±3.1 cm;  body weight:  94.7±2.0 kg,  BMI: 33.6±1.4 kg·m
−2
) were randomly
divided into four groups: control group (CG;n= 17), ASX supplement group (SG;n= 17),
CrossFit group (TG;n= 17), and training plus supplement group (TSG;n= 17). The flow of
participant recruitment is outlined in Figure 1. During the study, six individuals per group
declined to participate in the remaining protocol procedures due to medical, job, or lack
of interest reasons. Each group (collectively,n= 11) received instructions on performing
the training protocols during the third session. Following baseline measurements, the two
training groups (TG and TSG) attended CrossFit training (3 sessions/week) for12 weeks.
The control group participants were provided with instructions to maintain their existing
lifestyles throughout the duration of the trial.   The measurements for the study were
conducted simultaneously, with a time difference of around one hour, under similar climatic
circumstances, with a temperature of around 20
◦
C, and a humidity level of approximately
55%. The pre-and post-test measures were conducted 48 h before initiation and after the
end of the last training session, respectively.

2.2. Training Protocols
In  this  study,  the  HIFT  program  was  used,  which  included  CrossFit  training  in
36 sessions,  each session lasting 60 min and performed three times a week.   All HIFT
sessions were led by a CrossFit Level 1-certified trainer.  The first two sessions were de-
signed as an introduction to common movements used in HIFT (air squat, overhead squat,
front squat, press, push press, push jerk, deadlift, sumo deadlift high pull, and the medicine
ball clean). Starting on the third day, each HIFT session consisted of 10–15 min of stretches
and warm-ups; 10–20 min of instruction and practicing methods and movements; and
5–30 minof the workout of the day (WOD), conducted at a vigorous intensity according to
each individual’s fitness level. Workout modality components included aerobics (e.g., run-
ning, jumping rope), body weight (e.g., pull-ups, squats), and weightlifting (e.g., front
squats, kettlebell swings) exercises that were continuously varied using the CrossFit train-
ing template [34] in single, couplet, or triplet. All weights and movements were prescribed
24

Nutrients2023,15, 4803
and recorded separately for every HIFT participant [35]. Depending on the structure of the
WOD, timings to complete the WOD, rounds, and repetitions performed on the WOD, the
weights used and any necessary modifications to the scheduled workout were also noted
for each participant. For the HIFT group as a whole, average times for each WOD and the
total average WOD time per week were calculated.
2.3. Astaxanthin Supplementation Protocol
The participants in the SG and TSG were randomly allocated to receive a daily dose of
20 mg of ASX capsule (manufactured by Marine Product Tech. Inc., Seongnam, Republic
of  Korea)  or  a  placebo  consisting  of  a  20  mg  dose  of  a  raw  corn  starch  capsule.  This
administration took place once daily, with breakfast, for a duration of 12 weeks [36].
2.4. Nutrient Intake and Dietary Analysis
To evaluate changes in dietary habits, a set of three-day food records (consisting of
two weekdays and one weekend day) was obtained before and after the research. Every
meal item was individually inputted into Diet Analysis Plus version 10 (Cengage, Boston,
MA, USA) in order to determine the total calorie consumption and the relative distribution
of energy derived from fats, proteins, and carbohydrates [31].
2.5. Blood Markers
The procedure of blood testing was performed under standard conditions between
8 and 10 a.m. Samples for fasting blood sugar were drawn from the right arm 12 and 72 h
prior to the first exercise session and again at 72 h after the last session.EDTA-containing
tubes were used to transfer the blood samples,  which were centrifuged for10 minat
3000 rpmand stored at−70

lic, Catalogue No: RD191001100. Sensitivity: 0.2 ng/mL. Intra-CV = 5.9%, inter-CV = 5.6%).
Plasma adiponectin was measured with an ELISA kit (Biovendor, Czech Republic, Cata-
logue No: RD195023100. Sensitivity: 26 ng/mL. Intra-CV = 4.9%,inter-CV = 6.7%). Plasma
visfatin was measured with an ELISA kit (Cusabio,  China,  Catalog No: CSB-E08940h.
Sensitivity: 0.156 ng/mL. Intra-CV = < 8%, inter-CV = < 10%). Plasma vaspin was mea-
sured  with  an  ELISA  kit  (Biovendor,  Czech  Republic,  Catalogue  No:  RD191097200R.
Sensitivity:
0.01 ng/mL.   Intra-CV = 7.6%,  inter-CV = 7.7%).   Plasma RBP-4 was mea-
sured with an ELISA kit (R&D Systems, USA, and Catalogue No:  DRB400.  Sensitivity:

kit (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, USA, and Catalogue No: EK-057-23. Sensitivity: 0.07 ng/mL.
Intra-CV = < 10%, inter-CV = < 15%).  Plasma omentin-1 was measured with an ELISA
kit (Biovendor, Czech Republic, Catalogue No:  RD191100200R. Sensitivity:  0.5 ng/mL.
Intra-CV = 3.7%, inter-CV = 4.6%). Plasma chemerin levels were determined using a com-
mercially available ELISA kit (Biovendor, Czech, The intra-assay coefficient of variation
of chemerin was 5.1%).  The plasma levels of SEMA3C (MBS037239, MBS2883689, My-
BioSource, San Diego, CA, USA) were measured by commercially available enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits.
2.6. Statistical Analysis
G-power 3.1.9.2 software was used to calculate the sample size, and based on the
previous study, it was determined that there was a significant effect of combined training
on reducing leptin levels in overweight and obese males [37].  This study utilized the
equation for effect size (ES) to determine the impact of combined aerobic and resistance
training. In the present study, based on
α= 0.05, a power (1-β) of 0.95, and an effect size
(ES) = 1 ((5.4
−3.6)/1.65), a total sample size of at least 20 participants (n= 5 per group)
was required to detect significant changes in leptin levels. Nevertheless, given the absence
of prior studies investigating the impact of CrossFit on the measured adipokines in the
25

Nutrients2023,15, 4803
current investigation, along with the potential hindrance of COVID-19 on training and
adherence to supplementation, it was deemed necessary to increase the sample size (n= 17)
to maintain the statistical power of the study.  Descriptive statistics (means±standard
deviation) were used to describe all the data. The Shapiro Wilk test and two-way ANOVA
were used to assess the normality of the data and determine the group x time interaction,
respectively. One-way ANOVA and Fisher LSD post-hoc tests were used for the evaluation
of the baseline data of the four groups. In addition, pairwise comparisons were used to
determine mean differences when a significant difference between groups was detected by
ANOVA. Additionally, effect sizes (ES) were reported as partial eta-squared. In accordance
with Hopkins et al.  (2009), ES was considered trivial (<0.2), small (0.2–0.6), moderate
(
0.6–1.2), large (1.2–2.0), and very large (2.0–4.0). Statistical significance was determined
using ap-value threshold of less than 0.05. Pearson’s linear regressions were performed
with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Values ranging from 0 to 0.3 (or 0 to−0.3) are indicative
of a weak positive (negative) linear relationship through a shaky linear rule. Values ranging
from 0.3 to 0.7 (−0.3 to−0.7) are indicative of a moderate positive (negative) correlation.
Values falling within the range of 0.7 to 1.0 (−0.7 and−1.0) are indicative of a strong
positive (negative) correlation [38]. The statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 26,
while the generation of figures was carried out using GraphPad Prism (version 8.4.3).
3. Results
3.1. Compliance, Adverse Events, and Nutrient Intakes
Participant compliance was considered when≥80% of the supplements were con-
sumed. Six participants from each group withdrew due to personal reasons and COVID-19.
No adverse events were reported from both training and supplementation procedures.
Also, no changes in nutrient intakes were observed throughout the study (Table 1).

were not significantly different in the SG. Post-test values were significantly different in
comparison to the baseline for the rest of the variables in the SG, and also in the TG and
TSG for all of the adipokines (p= 0.001) in this study.
The increases in plasma adiponectin levels after 12 weeks of intervention in the TG
(p= 0.0001) and TSG (p= 0.0001) were significant, but not in the SG (p= 0.10) in comparison
to the CG. The differences were non-significant between the TSG and TG (p= 0.19), while
the differences between the SG and TG (p= 0.01) and the SG and TSG (p= 0.0001) were
statistically significant (Figure 2A). The changes in plasma leptin levels after 12 weeks of
intervention in the SG (p= 0.002), TG (p= 0.0001), and TSG (p= 0.0001) were significantly
lower in comparison to the CG; the differences between the SG and TSG (p= 0.02) were
statistically significant (Figure 2B).
Plasma levels of resistin were significantly decreased post-test compared to the baseline
in the SG (p= 0.033), TG (p= 0.003), and TSG (p= 0.0001). The differences between the SG
and TSG (p= 0.005), TSG and CG (p= 0.0001), and TG and CG (p= 0.0001) were statistically
significant (Figure 2C). The plasma levels of omentin-1 were significantly increased among
three interventional groups of the SG (p= 0.001), TG, and TSG (p= 0.0001) in comparison
with CG. There were also significant differences in the TG and TSG (p= 0.001) compared
with SG, as well as between the TG and TSG (p= 0.007) (Figure 2D). The plasma levels of
vaspin were significantly reduced only in 12-week training groups of the TG (p= 0.002)
and TSG (p= 0.001), while supplementation with (SG) was not different (p= 0.14). Vaspin
levels were different between the SG and TSG (p= 0.034), but not between the TG and TSG
(p= 0.74), nor between the SG and TG (p= 0.06) (Figure 2E). Plasma levels of visfatin were
changed in the TG (p= 0.018) and TSG (p= 0.0001), while there was no difference in the
SG (p= 0.054).  There were no differences between the SG and CG (p= 0.64), while the
differences between the SG and TSG (p= 0.011) and SG and TG (p= 0.035) were statistically
different (Figure 2F). Plasma levels of apelin were meaningfully reduced in the TG and TSG
(p= 0.0001), but not in the SG (p= 0.051). There were no differences in apelin between the
TG and TSG (p= 0.37), but there were differences between the SG and TSG (p= 0.004) and
also between the SG and TG (p= 0.038) (Figure 2G). The alterations of plasma RBP4 level
were significant in three interventional groups; the SG (p= 0.007), TG, and TSG (p= 0.0001)
following the 12-week interventions. There were, otherwise, significant differences between
the SG and TG (p= 0.009), SG and TSG (p= 0.0001), as well as between the TG and TSG
(p= 0.001) (Figure 2H). Similarly, 12 weeks of training and/or ASX supplementation altered
chemerin in the SG (p= 0.017), TG, and TSG (p= 0.001).  However, there were not any
significant differences between the SG and TG (p= 0.30), SG and TSG (p= 0.31), nor between
the TG and TSG (p= 0.97) in the changes of chemerin (Figure 2I). The plasma levels of
SEMA3C were significantly reduced in three groups of the SG (p= 0.002), TG, and TSG
(p= 0.0001) following 12-week ASX supplementation and CrossFit training. Based on the
results of the post-hoc test, there were non-significant differences between the SG and TG
(p= 0.057) and the TG and TSG (p= 0.58), but the changes between SG and TSG (p= 0.016)
were statistically significant (Figure 2J).
3.3. Weight and BMI
There were no between-group differences in baseline values for weight (p= 0.46) and
BMI (p= 0.57).  There were significant group X time interactions for weight (p= 0.0001,
η
2
= 0.46, statistical power = 0.999) and BMI (p= 0.002,η
2
= 0.30, statistical power = 0.998)
(Table 1).
Body weight reductions after 12 weeks were significant in the SG (p= 0.008), TG
(p= 0.0001), and TSG (p= 0.0001) but not in the CG (p= 0.32). Furthermore, the post-hoc
test for bodyweight shows that after 12 weeks there were significant changes in the CG
compared to the TG (p= 0.004) and TSG (p= 0.0001), and in the TSG compared to the TG
(p= 0.01) and SG (p= 0.0001), while other changes were not significant (p> 0.05) (Table 1).
Changes in BMI after 12 weeks were significantly decreased in the SG (p= 0.019), TG
(p= 0.0001), and TSG (p= 0.0001) but not in the CG (p= 0.37). BMI changes after 12 weeks
28

Nutrients2023,15, 4803
were significantly decreased in the TG (p= 0.016) and the TSG (p= 0.0001) compared to
the CG. The differences induced by training were significant between the TG and TSG
(p= 0.007) and between the SG and TSG (p= 0.007), while all other differences in BMI
between the groups were not significant (p> 0.05) (Table 1).
To investigate any potential relationships between training-induced changes in fat
mass (
ΔFM) and changes in adipokines (Δmarker, independently of groups), initially,
a correlation matrix was generated (Figure 3A). Adiponectin (Figure 3B) and omentin1
(Figure 3E) showed moderate negative relationships withΔFM, while leptin (Figure 3C),
vaspin (Figure 3F), visfatin (Figure 3G), apelin (Figure 3H), RBP4 (Figure 3I), chemerin
(Figure 3J), and SEMA3C (Figure 3K) showed a moderate positive relationship.  Also,
resistin (Figure 3D) showed a weak positive relationship. For linear regression of individual
Δ(adipokine) as a function ofΔFM, data were examined by the extra sum-of-squares F test
to first consider if pooled data could be considered as a single model. Only chemerin and
SEMA3C were considered a single group. All data except for resistin showed a significant
relationship with changes in FM (a trend was observed;p= 0.057).

4. Discussion
Adipokines play a key role in cardiometabolic health status, and circulating levels are
altered in obese states [39]. This study demonstrated that 12 weeks of CrossFit training and
ASX supplementation, separately and in combination, can improve circulating adipokines
levels in obese men. The combination of CrossFit and ASX supplementation overall led to
greater changes in measured outcomes compared to each intervention alone. In our previ-
ous study, it was shown that CrossFit training and ASX supplementation decreased the
plasma levels of GDF8, GDF15, CTRP2, and CTRP9. We also showed that CrossFit training
and ASX supplementation increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and VO
2peak
, and de-
creases low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol (TC), TG, and insulinresistance [30].
This is the first investigation using CrossFit training as a mode of exercise as well as in
combination with ASX supplementation on SEMA3C, apelin, chemerin, omentin1, visfatin,
resistin, adiponectin, leptin, vaspin, and RBP4 in males with obesity.
Adiponectin has been shown to be inversely associated with insulin resistance and
obesity [
40]. In the present study, it was shown that CrossFit and ASX supplementation
alone caused an increase in adiponectin in obese people, while this increase was greater in
the group that took CrossFit training and ASX supplementation together. Some studies con-
firm the results of our research [
41–43], while others do not show any change in adiponectin
levels following acute exercise [44,45].  This disagreement may have been related to the
laboratory protocols used [40]. Although the mechanism of action of CrossFit training in in-
creasing plasma adiponectin levels is not well understood, the secretion of catecholamines,
B-adrenergic receptors activity, and reduction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa) may
play a role [40]. Also, the increase in HDL and decrease in LDL, cholesterol, TG, and insulin
resistance in our research [30] can be one of the reasons for the increase in adiponectin.
Previous literature has also shown ASX supplementation increased serum adiponectin
levels (~26%) in adults with mild hyperlipidemia [
46]. The mechanisms underlying the
effect of ASX supplementation on adiponectin are unclear, but one of the possible reasons
could be reductions in TNFa through the activity of the peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor gamma (PPARγ) pathway [46].
Plasma leptin levels also decreased in each intervention group after 12 weeks. One
piece of research agrees with the results of this study [41,44,47], while others have shown
no effect of exercise in altering leptin levels [48–50]. These conflicting results may be due to
differences in exercise protocols. The decrease in leptin levels following CrossFit training
and ASX supplementation is likely related to the reduction of fat mass [40], which we
previously published for this sample [30]. With the advancement of technology along with
the improvements in living conditions, chronic diseases such as diabetes have increased
as a result of low physical activity levels and improper nutrition. As a result of these pro-
cesses, it is necessary to find safe interventions without complications [51]. Feng et al. [52]
observed that ASX supplementation led to an improvement of insulin sensitivity and
glucose tolerance through the suppression of inflammation, which reduced the symptoms
of diabetes. Due to the strong antioxidant role of ASX supplementation, its anti-obesity and
anti-inflammatory roles have been shown. For example, mechanisms include improving
glucose metabolism, lowering blood pressure, improving redox imbalance in lymphocytes,
and protectingβcells in the pancreas due to ASX supplementation has proven anti-diabetic
and anti-obesity properties [51].  ASX supplementation also accelerates the metabolism
of TG and HDL, reduces the incidence of cardiovascular disease, and increases the level
of adiponectin, which plays an important role in regulating blood glucose [
53].  The re-
searchers observed that ASX reduced the production of nitric oxide (NO), leading to a
reduction in insulin resistance through increased serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor
substrate 1 (IRS1). In their study, Xia et al. [24] showed that ASX supplementation leads to
a decrease in the size of fat cells through the activation of PPARγ. This leads to a decrease
in plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels, which confirms the results of Hussein et al. [54].
Aoi et al. [23]observed in their study that ASX supplementation leads to a reduction in the
oxidative damage of carnitine palmitoyl transferase I (CPTI). This factor plays an impor-
30

Nutrients2023,15, 4803
tant role in the oxidation of fatty acids in the mitochondrial membrane of muscle tissue.
Contradictory results have been observed regarding the effect of ASX supplementation;
some showed a non-significant increase, and others showed no change or decrease [
23].
Hossein et al. [
54] showed that long-term ASX supplementation (50 mg/kg/day) led to
an increase in plasma adiponectin levels. Yoshida et al. [46] also observed these changes.
Further research should be performed to determine the most effective dose and duration of
treatment to increase blood adiponectin levels under different conditions.
In addition to reducing oxidative stress, ASX supplementation led to an increase in the
serum levels of adiponectin in obese rats [
55]. The effective mechanism of this process leads
to the suppression of liver cancer in obese people [46]. Due to increased hormone-sensitive
lipase activity in response to CrossFit training in obese participants, adiponectin levels
increased significantly, and this led to body fat regulation. The important role of leptin is
in energy balance and appetite control, and as a result, the level of this hormone is low in
obese people. The cause of increased leptin in obese people can be attributed to resistance
to leptin [56].  The normal level of this hormone is between 1 and 15 ng/mL in normal
people, and more than 30 ng/mL in obese people [
57].  Chronic high-intensity training
has led to a decrease in blood leptin levels in obese participants [
58]. The mechanism of
this reduction was the reduction of body fat levels. Exercise leads to a decrease in leptin
levels and an increase in adiponectin levels [56]. Some of the different results obtained can
be due to different training protocols, variables under investigation, and more. However,
in general, it has been observed that long-term training has a greater effect on leptin and
adiponectin levels [59,60].  Due to its intensity and sufficient duration, CrossFit training
leads to a decrease in body weight and a change in body composition through a negative
balance created between energy intake and energy consumption [61].  Adiponectin and
leptin are among the most well-known cytokines, which are secreted by adipose tissue and
play an important role in metabolic and anti-inflammatory processes.  In many chronic
diseases, low levels of adiponectin and high levels of leptin play an important role in
disease progression [40,62].
In the present study, after CrossFit workouts, the level of plasma omentin-1 signifi-
cantly increased [63]. The effect of aerobic or resistance training on omentin-1 is conflicting,
with studies showing increased levels [64,65] or unchanged levels [60]. In our previously
published study [30] and other studies [59,60], the mechanism of increase in the level of
omentin-1 has been shown, due to the reduction of body weight and improvement of
cardiometabolic status. The level of omentin1 decreases in proportion to the increase in
obesity [
66], and the use of interventions to reduce body weight such as diet and active
lifestyle leads to an increase in the level of omentin-1 [67]. This leads to weight loss, and
as a result, the level of omentin1 increases [21,68]. Omentin is produced in adipose tissue;
it seems that myokines released by muscle cells in response to positive exercise affect
omentin1 levels [68].
The possible mechanism of visfatin reduction in different studies may be due to the
intensity of training and the amount of changes in body weight and body fat volume.
Also, vaspin is an adipokine that improves insulin sensitivity as a result of reducing body
fat due to exercise, leading to an increase in its serum levels [69].  SEMA3C is a protein
that plays an important role in the development of nervous, cardio-respiratory, kidney
systems, and various oncogenesis [70]. This adipokine is secreted from subcutaneous fat
tissues, and its level of secretion is related to obesity level, fat cell morphology, and weight
changes [70].  Few studies have been performed on the effect of exercise training on the
SEMA3C level. Limited research has found a decrease in serum SEMA3C levels following
long-term training,  and this decrease was significantly associated with improvements
in  body  weight  and  body  fat  levels  [
70].   Also,  the  increase  in  HDL  and  decrease  in
LDL, TG, and insulin resistance in our research [
30] can be one of the reasons for the
decreased SEMA3C level.  The current investigation shows that a 12-week regimen of
CrossFit exercise training, in conjunction with a 20 mg dosage of ASX supplementation,
resulted in a substantial decrease in adipokines that are directly associated with obesity.

The observed enhancement was more pronounced in the group that had concurrent Crossfit
training and ASX supplementation.
Study Limitations
There are various limitations inherent in our investigation.  Initially, the processes
behind the potential enhancement of adipokine levels by bioactive constituents of ASX
were not determined. Furthermore, the generalizability of our research is limited due to
the exclusion of females in the enrollment of patients.  Another limitation of our study
is the lack of measurement of adipokine levels. Furthermore, it should be noted that the
current body of research on the impact of ASX and CrossFit training on adipokines is mini-
mal. Consequently, the precise processes behind this relationship remain undetermined.
Therefore, further investigation is needed to elucidate potential pathways.
5. Conclusions
Our research presents novel insights regarding the impact of a combined regimen of
CrossFit training and ASX supplementation on adipokines in males with obesity. Our data
suggest that non-drug strategies such as ASX supplementation with CrossFit training can
reduce SEMA3C, apelin, chemerin, visfatin, RBP4, resistin, vaspin, and leptin, and increase
adiponectin and omentin1 in males with obesity. Consequently, individuals with obesity
are recommended to include CrossFit exercise in their physical activity regimen and use
ASX supplements in their dietary intake.

Abstract:Creatine has been used to maximize resistance training effects on skeletal muscles, including
muscle hypertrophy and fiber type changes.  This study aimed to evaluate the impact of creatine
supplementation on the myostatin pathway and myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms in the slow-
and fast-twitch muscles of resistance-trained rats.   Twenty-eight male Wistar rats were divided
into four groups:  a sedentary control (Cc),  sedentary creatine supplementation (Cr),  resistance
training (Tc),  and resistance training combined with creatine supplementation (Tcr).   Cc and Tc
received standard commercial chow;  Cr and Tcr received a 2% creatine-supplemented diet.   Tc
and Tcr performed a resistance training protocol on a ladder for 12 weeks.  Morphology, MyHC
isoforms, myostatin, follistatin, and ActRIIB protein expressions were analyzed in soleus and white
gastrocnemius portion samples. The results were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test.
Tc and Tcr exhibited higher performance than their control counterparts. Resistance training increased
the ratio between muscle and body weight, the cross-sectional area, as well as the interstitial collagen
fraction.  Resistance training alone increased MyHC IIx and follistatin while reducing myostatin
(p< 0.001)and ActRIIB (p= 0.040) expressions in the gastrocnemius.  Resistance training induced
skeletal muscle hypertrophy and interstitial remodeling, which are more evident in the gastrocnemius
muscle. The effects were not impacted by creatine supplementation.

1. Introduction
In the diverse world of commercial supplements, creatine monohydrate stands out as
being widely used by high-level athletes and physically active individuals [1–3]. Creatine
monohydrate consumption can impact skeletal muscle through multiple mechanisms
which sustain muscle remodeling [
4].  Creatine supplementation is commonly used to
maximize the effects of resistance training, including neuromuscular recruitment, increased
protein synthesis, and muscle fiber type changes [5–9].

Combinations between exercise training and creatine interventions resulted in greater
lean mass and lower muscle protein catabolism [10,11].  Another possible effect of cre-
atine supplementation is the adaptive modulation of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) iso-
forms in skeletal muscle fibers [
12–16].  MyHC isoform profiles determine the muscle
fiber  phenotype;  in  general,  predominantly  MyHC  I  fibers  have  greater  slow  twitch-
oxidative characteristics, while fibers containing more MyHC II mostly have a fast glycolytic
metabolism [17,18]. Skeletal muscles have a diverse proportion and distribution of highly
adaptable fiber types so that phenotypical aspects can be affected by several molecular
signaling pathways, which regulate protein synthesis and myogenic activity [19,20].
Myostatin, an extracellular myokine that is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle,
plays a crucial role in downregulating muscle mass and modulating fiber-type compo-
sition [
21,22].  Its expression is inversely associated with the amount of fast glycolytic
fibers [
23–26].  Myostatin signaling is complex and comprises the activation of several
downstream pathways. Mature myostatin binds to the Type IIB activin receptor (ActRIIB)
and initiates signaling cascades that upregulate the genes involved in atrophy and down-
regulate genes involved in myogenesis. Among potential myostatin inhibitors, follistatin
is an antagonist of transforming growth factor-β(TGF-β) family members, inhibiting the
link of myostatin to ActRIIB. In this context, follistatin overexpression can be associated
with skeletal muscle hypertrophy [21,27].
Resistance exercise training has been associated with reduced serum myostatin levels,
as well as follistatin modulation [28] and increased muscle mass; these effects were ampli-
fied in response to creatine supplementation [29].In vitrostudies have shown that creatine
prevents or reverses myostatin-induced muscle atrophy and increases the expression of
myostatin-negative regulatory genes [
30].  In pigs and chickens, creatine supplementa-
tion increased myogenic factor expression and reduced myostatin mRNA levels [
31,32].
However, the impact of a combination of resistance training and creatine supplementation
on morphology, MyHC isoform expression, and myostatin pathway signaling in skeletal
muscles has not been clarified.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of creatine monohydrate supple-
mentation on morphology, MyHC isoform expression, and myostatin pathway signaling
in gastrocnemius (white portion) and the soleus muscles of rats submitted to resistance
training. Since the gastrocnemius muscle superficial area (white portion) is characterized
by the predominance of fast-twitch fibers, while the soleus is a classical slow-twitch muscle,
these muscles were used in this study.  We hypothesized that a combination of creatine
monohydrate supplementation and resistance training could attenuate myostatin expres-
sion and modulate downstream targets, promoting more accentuated changes in white
gastrocnemius than in the soleus muscle.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Animal and Experimental Design
Male Wistar rats (60 days old) were assigned to four groups: a sedentary control (Cc,
n= 7), sedentary creatine supplementation (Cr,n= 7), resistance training (Tc,n= 7), and
resistance training combined with creatine supplementation (Tcr,n= 7). Cc and Tc groups
received a daily diet of commercial rodent chow (Nuvilab
®
CR1,  Curitiba,  PR, Brazil;
3.6 kcal/g); Cr and Tcr groups received the same standard daily diet but supplemented
with creatine monohydrate at a dosage of 2% daily diet weight (3.7 kcal/g) [
33,34].  Tc
and Tcr groups were submitted to a ladder-climbing resistance training protocol [35]. All
animals received water ad libitum and were housed (three rats per cage) under controlled
temperature and humidity conditions with 12 h light/dark cycles.   The experimental
protocol duration was 12 weeks.
All procedures and the experimental protocol were approved by our institution’s
Animal Ethics Committee (Protocol Number 873/2017) in accordance with the Brazilian
College of Animal Experimentation (COBEA) and the US National Institutes of Health
“Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” (NIH, 2011).

2.2. Climbing Exercise Familiarization
All trained rats were familiarized with the climbing exercise protocol for three days
with a 10% animal body weight load.  A total of 8 to 12 climbing sets were considered a
complete session during familiarization [36,37].
2.3. Initial Maximal Carrying Capacity
All  rats  were  submitted  to  incremental  tests  to  determine  their  initial  maximum
carrying capacity.  The climbing test was performed against a 75% animal body weight
load. After a 120 s interval, a 30 g load was added to the resistance apparatus for a new
climb.   The test was completed when the maximal load resulted in exhaustion or the
impossibility of additional climbing. The test was also stopped when eight exercise sets
were completed. The highest weight carried to the top of the ladder was considered the
maximal load [35–39].
2.4. Resistance Training Protocol
Resistance training groups performed resistance training three times per week during
the dark cycle for 12 weeks, resulting in a total of 36 sessions.  Each session consisted
of four to nine climbs.  The first four climbs were performed with 50%, 75%, 90%, and
100% of the maximal resistance load achieved during the incremental test. Then, 30 g loads
were progressively added to each subsequent climb up to the daily limit of 9 climbs [35].
Resistance loads consisted of lead weights placed in conical plastic flasks, which were
attached to the proximal part of the rat tail.
2.5. Final Maximal Carrying Capacity
The maximal carrying capacity test was repeated after 12 weeks to determine the final
maximal performance.
2.6. General Characteristics, Tissue Collection, and Serum Biochemical Analysis
Food consumption was measured daily, and body weight (BW) was evaluated weekly.
Calorie intake was calculated as follows: daily food consumption x diet energy density.
Feed efficiency (the ability to convert calorie intake into BW) was determined by dividing
BW gain (g) by the total calorie intake (Kcal) [40]. Ingested creatine was calculated from
2% of the total food intake. At the end of the experiment, the rats were submitted to 6–8 h
fasting, were anesthetized with thiopental (80 mg/kg), and euthanized by decapitation.
Blood was collected for biochemical analyses, and the serum was separated by centrifuga-
tion at 3000×gfor 10 min and then stored at−80
◦
C for subsequent assessment. Glucose,
cholesterol, triglycerides, albumin, and total protein serum levels were determined by spec-
trophotometry using enzymatic kits [40,41]. The gastrocnemius and soleus muscles from
both pelvic limbs were quickly removed and weighed. After that, muscle samples were
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at−80
◦
C until analysis. The right tibia
was dissected, measured using a pachymeter, and used to normalize muscle mass [41,42].
2.7. Skeletal Muscle Morphology
Total gastrocnemius and soleus muscle weights in both absolute values and respec-
tive ratios with body weight and tibia length were used to characterize the macroscopic
morphology. Soleus and white (superficial) portions of gastrocnemius muscles were used
to obtain cross-sectional histological sections (8-μm-thick) using a cryostat at−20
◦
C. The
slides were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) to assess the cross-sectional area; at least
150 fibers were measured per animal. Other histological slides were submitted to Picrosirius
red (Sirius red F3BA) staining; at least 10 fields per animal were digitalized and used to
calculate the interstitial collagen fraction [
41,43].  Histological analyzes were performed
at 400
×magnification using a Leica DM5500B microscope (Wetzlar, Germany) coupled
to a digital image projection video camera equipped with Leica Application Suite version
4.0.0 (Heerbrugg, Switzerland). Cross-sectional fiber areas were measured using Image J

software (Wayne Rasbandat NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA), and an interstitial collagen frac-
tion was quantified using Image Pro-plus Version 6.0.0.260 (Media Cybernetics, Rockville,
MD, USA).
2.8. Western Blotting
Protein levels were analyzed by Western blot according to previous studies [41–44].
Protein was extracted using a RIPA buffer (1 mL/100 mg tissue) containing protease and
phosphatase inhibitors. The supernatant protein content was quantified by the Bradford
assay [45].  Samples were separated into a polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane. After blockade with 5% skimmed milk in TBST for 1 h, the mem-
brane was incubated overnight at 4
◦
C with specific antibodies:  anti-myostatin (GDF-8,
sc-6885-R)—dilution 1:200, anti-follistatin (sc-30194)—dilution 1:400, and anti-ActRIIB (sc-
376593)—dilution 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA).
The membrane was then washed with TBS and Tween 20 and incubated with a secondary
peroxidase-conjugated antibody (90 min at room temperature). Enhanced Chemio Lumi-
nescence (Luminata Crescendo
®
reagent, Merck Millipore; Darmstadt, Germany) was used
to detect bound antibodies [41].  The membrane was then incubated with a ReBlot Plus
Strong Antibody Stripping Solution, 10
×—Millipore (Burlington, MA, USA), to remove
the antibodies attached to the membrane.  The blockade process was repeated, and the
membrane was incubated overnight at 4
◦
C with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydroge-
nase (GAPDH, sc-32233, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA). The procedure
continued as described above until a signal was detected.  Afterward, respective bands
were quantified by densitometry using a Gel-Pro Analyzer 3.1. The results obtained for
each protein were normalized to those obtained for GAPDH.
2.9. Myosin Heavy Chain Isoforms
MyHC isoforms were quantified after electrophoresis in a sodium dodecyl sulfate-
polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) [46,47]. Frozen samples were mechanically homogenized
in a protein extraction solution containing a 50 mM phosphate potassium lysis buffer
0.5 mL/50 mg tissue.   The total protein quantification was performed in supernatant
aliquots by the Bradford method. Small volumes of the diluted extracts (10μL) were loaded
onto a 7–10% SDS-PAGE separating gel with a 4% stacking gel, which was run overnight
(27 h) at 70 V and stained with Coomassie blue R (Sigma-Aldrich
®
, St. Louis, MO, USA).
MyHC isoforms were quantified by densitometry and identified based on predominant
fiber types in studied muscles samples, as reported previously [48–50]. MyHC I and MyHC
IIa isoforms were observed in the soleus muscle, and MyHC IIx and MyHC IIb isoforms
were found in the gastrocnemius white portion. The relative quantity was expressed as a
percentage of the total MyHC expression.
2.10. Statistical Analysis
The results were expressed as the mean±standard deviations. The data distribution
was analyzed using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.  Student’s t-test was used to compare
creatine intake between Cr and Tcr groups. Other variables were evaluated using a two-way
analysis of variance (Two-Way ANOVA). When significant differences were found (p< 0.05)
post hoc, Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was performed. The level of significance was 5%.
3. Results
3.1. Maximal Carrying Capacity
Before the training protocol, experimental groups exhibited similar performance dur-
ing the maximal carrying capacity test (Cc 228±36; Cr 225±33; Tc 236±19;Tcr 242±25 g;
p> 0.05).  After training, Tc and Tcr presented a higher load-bearing capacity than their
respective controls (Cc 465±38; Cr 434±48; Tc 1284±79; Tcr 1285±127 g; Figure 1).

experimental protocol, exercise training intervention resulted in a lower final body weight;
Tc exhibited reduced body weight when compared to the Cc and Tcr groups.  The total
caloric intake did not differ between groups.  Feed efficiency was lower in Tc and Tcr
than Cc and Cr, respectively, and was higher in Cr than Cc. Creatine intake did not differ
between Cr and Tcr groups (Table 1).

3.4. Myosin Heavy Chain Isoforms Distribution
Figures 4 and 5 show MyHC isoform expressions in the gastrocnemius white portion
and soleus muscles, respectively. Gastrocnemius showed significant effects from exercise
training alone (p= 0.022); MyHC IIx expression increased in response to resistance training
(Cc 6.25±2.68; Cr 8.88±2.94; Tc 11.47±3.73; Tcr 12.30±6.58%). MyHC IIb expression
was lower in the trained groups than in the controls (Cc 93.75±2.68; Cr 91.12±2.94;
Tc 88,53±3.73; Tcr 87.70±6.58%).
The soleus muscle’s MyHC IIa isoform expression was similar between the groups
(Cc 9.43±4.08; Cr 10.19±4.43, Tc 7.87±3.50, Tcr 8.92±3.40%). Likewise, the MyHC I iso-
form was not affected by dietary intervention or resistance exercise training (
Cc 90.57±4.08;
Cr 89.81±4.43, Tc 92.13±3.50, Tcr 91.08±3.40%; Figure 5).

4. Discussion
The current study aimed to evaluate the effects of creatine monohydrate supplementa-
tion when combined with resistance training on the soleus, a classic slow-twitch muscle,
and gastrocnemius white portion, an important fast-twitch muscle type. In contrast to our
hypothesis, creatine supplementation, both alone or combined with resistance training, had
little impact on morphological and molecular features in both skeletal muscle types. On
the other hand, the resistance exercise training intervention resulted in morphological and
molecular adaptive effects in both skeletal muscles; these effects were more accentuated in
the gastrocnemius than in the soleus muscle, partially confirming the primary hypothesis.
Indeed, resistance exercise training is a non-pharmacological intervention that, when
performed continuously and safely, can result in metabolic benefits and promote phys-
iological and structural adaptations that are associated with improved neuromuscular
function and motor performance [51–55]. In this study, resistance training was associated
with lower triglyceride serum levels and an increased maximal load-carrying capacity,
confirming the primary premise as well as findings derived from animal models [
56,57].
Moreover, the 12 weeks resistance training protocol increased the mass, cross-sectional
area, collagen interstitial fraction, MyHC IIx proportion, and follistatin expression while
reducing myostatin and ActRIIB protein levels in the gastrocnemius white portion muscle.
Likewise, exercise training resulted in a greater collagen interstitial fraction in the soleus

muscle.  When combined with creatine supplementation, the ladder resistance training
protocol reduced the follistatin level expression in the gastrocnemius muscle (Figure 9).
 
Figure 9.Differential effects of ladder resistance training and creatine monohydrate supplementation
on gastrocnemius (white portion) and soleus muscles. Resistance training-induced skeletal muscle
remodeling is greater in the fast-twitch than the slow-twitch muscle type.
Skeletal muscle is highly adaptable to increased muscle load, presenting compen-
satory hypertrophy with improved strength [
51,58,59].  In accordance with our results,
Ribeiro et al. [60]observed that resistance training on a ladder (3×/week for 12 weeks)
induced hypertrophy that was restricted to the gastrocnemius muscle in three-month-old
rats; the cross-sectional area in the soleus muscle was unaffected by the intervention. Based
on a similar protocol, Deschenes et al. [61] failed to show a significant increase in the cross-
sectional area of soleus muscle fibers after resistance training for six weeks. By contrast,
rodents that submitted to an alternative training protocol (16 weeks; 5×/week) exhibited
a greater soleus cross-sectional area [62]. This is perhaps because soleus remodeling can
be associated with greater volume and duration protocols. It is noteworthy that resistance
training is predominantly associated with fast-twitch Type II fibers hypertrophy in the
skeletal muscle [51,63–65]. Type II muscle fibers respond preferentially to intense training
protocols, while Type I muscles are more susceptible to high-volume exercise [66]. Besides
these morphological effects, the muscle recruitment pattern in response to exercise training
may also be associated with different MyHC stimuli.  Accordingly, resistance training
preferentially impacted the MyHC IIx proportion in gastrocnemius white portion muscles
with no changes in the soleus muscle composition (Figures 4 and 5).
Additionally, resistance training promoted extensive interstitial remodeling in both
skeletal muscle types. Recently, Braggion et al. [67] also observed that training performed
on a ladder (3×/week for 12 weeks) increased collagen fibers in the soleus skeletal muscle
of ovariectomized rats. The upregulation of collagen turnover due to prolonged training
could be caused by the increased activity of fibroblasts involved in muscle hypertrophy
and regeneration [67,68]. This change may provide mechanical support to muscle fibers,
as resistance training promotes a high contractile demand to multiple skeletal muscles,
despite different histological, biochemical, and metabolic properties [51].

Considering these molecular mechanisms, resistance training reduced myostatin expres-
sion in the gastrocnemius white portion. Myostatin, also known as growth/differentiation
factor-8 (GDF-8), is a TGF-βfamily member [21]. While myostatin overexpression reduces
muscle mass, myostatin null animals have an increased muscle mass [69,70]. This effect has
been observed with natural myostatin mutations in animals and humans [71–74]. Support-
ing the findings of our study, myostatin mRNA expression decreased in elderly women
after resistance training [
75]. Hayashi et al. [76] described how increased myostatin was
associated with the reduced expression of the fast MyHC IIx isoform in cattle. Likewise,
Ribeiro et al. [60] observed reduced myostatin levels in male rat gastrocnemius in response
to 12-week ladder resistance training. Relative to follistatin expression, the results of this
study confirm previous evidence [77,78]; resistance exercise training positively modulates
follistatin and negatively modulates myostatin and ActRIIB, which are associated with
gastrocnemius hypertrophy.  In addition to inhibiting myostatin binding to its receptor,
follistatin may have anabolic activity, which depends on insulin-like growth factor-1 or
insulin [79]. In this context, creatine supplementation could improve the activity of com-
ponents in the insulin signaling pathway [80].  This possibility may have supported the
higher follistatin expression in the soleus skeletal muscle (Figure 7) of trained rats that were
creatine supplemented.
In general, exercise resistance training effects are frequently accentuated by creatine
supplementation [4]. In previous studies, creatine supplementation promoted an increase
in muscle mass during resistance training with a progressive overload increase [12,81].
However, Cooke et al. [
82] observed that 12 weeks of creatine supplementation did not
modify the lean mass, muscle strength, total myofibrillar protein content, and/or muscle
fiber cross-sectional area in men undergoing resistance training. Similarly, creatine supple-
mentation did not promote any direct anabolic effect on the skeletal muscles of rats that
were submitted to 5 weeks of intense jumping resistance training [48]. The authors argued
for the possible benefits of creatine supplementation in terms of hypertrophic mechanisms
activation and additional muscle mass gain in trained rats, which was dependent on a
higher workload [48].
Based on the principle of specificity, physiological adaptations due to resistance ex-
ercise training are dependent on specific stress characteristics [83]. From this perspective,
potential effects depend on a combination of training variables and, generally, are associated
with metabolic stress due to glycolysis overload [52,84]. Although creatine monohydrate
supplementation could contribute to improvements in glycolysis, it is predominantly bene-
ficial to increase muscle mass through the creatine and phosphocreatine systems [83]. Thus,
any anabolic effect from creatine ingestion could be more pronounced when associated with
ladder resistance training protocols based on greater workloads resulting from increases
in rest periods as well as the number of sets within a session and/or frequency of work-
outs per week. Therefore, a mismatch between exercise training demand and nutritional
supplementation may not be discarded as a possible background for the little effect of
creatine consumption in this study. Further investigation is needed to clarify the potential
creatine-induced molecular mechanisms modulating the skeletal muscle phenotype.
Moreover, although lactate concentration is commonly used to determine resistance
training intensity, this variable was not evaluated to determine functional capacity, which
can be considered an additional limitation in this study.
5. Conclusions
Resistance exercise training induces skeletal muscle hypertrophy and interstitial re-
modeling in rats, which is more evident in the gastrocnemius muscle white portion than
in the soleus muscle.  This adaptive response can be associated with the myostatin sig-
naling pathway modulation and increased MyHC IIx expression and is not affected by
creatine supplementation.

Abstract:Myokines represent important regulators of muscle metabolism.  Our study aimed to
explore the effects of a cyclical ketogenic reduction diet (CKD) vs. a nutritionally balanced reduction
diet (RD) combined with regular resistance/aerobic training in healthy young males on serum
concentrations of myokines and their potential role in changes in physical fitness.   Twenty-five
subjects undergoing regular resistance/aerobic training were randomized to the CKD (n= 13) or
RD (n= 12) groups. Anthropometric and spiroergometric parameters, muscle strength, biochemical
parameters, and serum concentrations of myokines and cytokines were assessed at baseline and after
8 weeks of intervention. Both diets reduced body weight, body fat, and BMI. Muscle strength and
endurance performance were improved only by RD. Increased musclin (32.9 pg/mL vs.74.5 pg/mL,
p= 0.028) and decreased osteonectin levels (562 pg/mL vs. 511 pg/mL,p= 0.023) were observed in
RD but not in the CKD group. In contrast, decreased levels of FGF21 (181 pg/mL vs.86.4 pg/mL,
p= 0.003)  were  found  in  the  CKD  group  only.   Other  tested  myokines  and  cytokines  were  not
significantly affected by the intervention.  Our data suggest that changes in systemic osteonectin
and musclin levels could contribute to improved muscle strength and endurance performance and
partially explain the differential effects of CKD and RD on physical fitness.

1. Introduction
A diet with a nutritionally suitable composition is a necessary prerequisite for both
professional and amateur sportsmen to enable appropriate energy expenditure and ensure
optimal physical performance.   For aesthetic and performance reasons,  these subjects
frequently undergo weight loss in order to reduce body fat amount. However, this may
be accompanied by a loss of lean body mass, which can often reach up to 25% of the total
weight loss [1,2]. For this purpose, the aim of such approaches is to maximize the reduction
of adipose tissue while maintaining muscle mass. To achieve weight loss, it is necessary to

increase the energy deficit, which most often means reducing energy intake. There are many
types of reduction diets; however, most of them are similar in many points [3]. A caloric
reduction of 500–750 calories per day is recommended by many obesity societies [4,5].
To reduce the number of calories, lipids or carbohydrates are usually restricted. Neither
macronutrient, fat (low-fat diets) nor carbohydrate (low-carb diets), has been determined
to be more important for weight loss as long as a caloric deficit occurs.  An extremely
low energy intake from carbohydrates (<10%) may result in nutritional ketosis [
6]. This
type of diet is called the ketogenic diet and is usually accompanied by elevated fat and
protein content, with a daily protein intake of 0.8–1.5 g/kg body weight to preserve muscle
mass [6,7].  The magnitude and duration of the energy deficit determine the amount of
weight loss. Resistance exercise is often used to restrict the loss of lean mass [8].
Skeletal muscle and bone are connected anatomically and physiologically and play
a crucial role in human locomotion and metabolism. Historically, the coupling between
muscle and bone has been viewed in the light of mechanotransduction, which declares
that the mechanical forces applied to muscle are transmitted to the skeleton to initiate
bone formation.  However, these tissues also communicate through an endocrine route
orchestrated by a family of bioactive molecules referred to as myokines (derived from
myocytes), osteokines (derived from bone cells), and adipokines (derived from adipose
tissue) [9].
Myokines are small proteins, released by skeletal muscle cells in response to muscle
contractions, which have important autocrine, paracrine, and/or endocrine effects, includ-
ing the regulation of energy metabolism.  Experimental studies have demonstrated that
some of the myokines can be directly involved in the regulation of muscle strength and
endurance, thus possibly contributing to the integration of the effects of different diets and
various types of exercise on the parameters of physical fitness [10].
One of the myokines with important effects on metabolic regulation and muscle
growth and performance is musclin.  Musclin is produced by bone and skeletal muscle
cells and plays a crucial role in the regulation of bone growth and physical endurance by
enhancing the growth of muscle fibers and their regeneration [11–13].  In experimental
settings,  musclin attenuated inflammation and oxidative stress in doxorubicin (DOX)-
induced cardiotoxicity [14].
Osteonectin, also known as secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), is
another important tissue-specific protein, linking the bone mineral and collagen phases and
contributing to the initiation of active mineralization in normal skeletal tissue. Osteonectin
is an important modulator of the actin cytoskeleton that may be involved in the maintenance
of muscular function by binding to actin in regenerating myofibers [15–17]. Several other
myokines, such as interleukin 6 (IL6), irisin, insulin growth factor (IGF-1), brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF), myostatin, and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), exert
anabolic/catabolic effects on bone and muscle, and their appropriate balance contributes to
the physiological regulation of muscle and bone mass [9]. Especially FGF21 was found to
be required for fasting-induced muscle atrophy and weakness [18].
In addition to its effects on body composition, there is growing evidence that a keto-
genic diet may be a potential therapeutic approach for Alzheimer ’s disease or other types of
cognitive impairment via inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β
(IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factorα(TNF-α)[19–21]. These cytokines are also known to
accelerate catabolism, induce contractile dysfunction, disrupt myogenesis, and overall
modulate muscle tissue loss (summarized in [
22]). Their inhibition can therefore lead to
improved muscle function. Moreover, a ketogenic diet may improve insulin sensitivity by
reducing carbohydrate intake and promoting weight loss. This can help prevent the devel-
opment of type 2 diabetes and also, in turn, reduce the risk of sleep apnea and affect a wide
variety of other physiological regulations, including the endocannabinoid system [23–26].
Taken together, myokines represent an important interconnection between the effects
of diet and exercise and the growth of muscle fibers and their regeneration, modulation
of angiogenesis, and also the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism [
27].  We have
55

previously demonstrated that a nutritionally balanced reduction diet (RD), but not cyclical
ketogenic  diet  (CKD),  in  healthy  young  males  undergoing  regular  resistance/aerobic
training improved muscle strength and endurance performance, while both reduced body
weight to a similar degree [28].
Here, we explored possible mechanisms behind the different effects of RD vs. CKD
on physical performance.   The main aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that
exercise-induced myokines are produced differently according to the type of diet protocol
selected and thus differentially affect physical performance.  To this end, we measured
serum concentrations of selected myokines and cytokines in healthy young males on RD or
CKD undergoing regular resistance/aerobic training at baseline and after eight weeks of
training combined with their respective diets.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Subjects
In our earlier paper [28], the specific study subjects’ characteristics and the training
regimen were laid forth in detail. In summary, 25 healthy young male volunteers with a
wide range of fitness and at least a year of resistance training experience were recruited
through physical education colleges and through a website with people interested in
nutrition and exercise. Ages between 18 and 30 years and at least a year of resistance and
aerobic training experience were requirements for inclusion. Participants who expressed
interest in taking part were assessed to make sure they met the requirements for enrollment
in this study.
Exclusion criteria included the existence of cardiovascular disorders, diabetes mellitus,
arterial hypertension, or any other illnesses that required pharmacological treatment. These
ailments could impact athletes’ ability to perform in sports or put them at risk for subse-
quent injuries.  Additionally, participants were required to stop using any performance-
enhancing supplements (such as creatine,β-hydroxy-β-methyl butyrate, caffeine, protein
powder, weight gainer, thermogenic, etc.) at least one week before baseline testing and to
refrain from doing so for the duration of this study.
This  study  was  authorized  by  the  Human  Ethics  Review  Board,  First  Faculty  of
Medicine and General University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic (ethical approval code
764/18 S-IV) and performed in agreement with the principles of the WMA Declaration
of Helsinki—Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects [29]. All
subjects were required to sign informed consent forms before randomization.
For eight weeks, participants were randomized by an electronic randomization system
to follow either CKD or RD (both requiring a 500 kcal/day reduction in total calorie intake)
while engaging in three resistance exercise sessions and three cardio exercises per week
(30 minrun, heart rate around 130–140 beats/min). From a balanced hypocaloric diet with
a reduction of energy intake of 500 to 1000 kcal from the regular caloric intake, a total
caloric intake reduction of 500 kcal/day was calculated. Such diets are suggested by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the “standard therapy” for clinical trials [30].
2.2. Baseline and Postinterventional Testing
Medical history, anthropometric measurements, power performance tests, cycling
spiroergometry, blood draws while fasting to gather laboratory data, and data collection
during  baseline  and  post-intervention  testing  after  8  weeks  were  all  part  of  the  data
collection process. By applying the height measurement, the scale determined the body
mass index (BMI). A simple stadiometer was used to measure height accurately (Seca 222,
Seca Co., Birmingham, UK).
2.2.1. Biochemical and Anthropometric Examination
At the beginning of this study, the BMIs of all subjects were computed. InBody Body
Composition Analyzers were used to measure body composition (InBody230, InBody Co.,
Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea). Body weight and other measurements of body composition,
56

Nutrients2023,15, 1720
such as lean body mass, body fat mass, BMI, water content, and body fat percentage, were
taken, with measurements of the subject’s weight being taken to the nearest 0.5 kg.
Blood samples were taken before this study began and at its conclusion, eight weeks
following the diet, for biochemical measurements. After centrifuging the serum, samples
were kept in aliquots at 80
◦
C until additional analysis. The longest period of storage was
8 months.
Biochemical parameters were estimated by spectrophotometric methods using the
ARCHITECT c Systems device (Abbott Park, IL, USA) in the Department of Biochemistry of
the Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine in Prague. Serum levels of myokines
(brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3), fractalkine,
follistatin-like protein 1 (FSTL1), IL6, musclin, oncostatin M, osteonectin) were analyzed by
the multiplex assay MILLIPLEX
®
Human Myokine Magnetic Bead Panel (HMYOMAG-
56K; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and cytokines/chemokines (Interferon gamma
(IFNγ), IL8, IL10, IL23, TNFαwere measured by the multiplex assay MILLIPLEX
®
Human
Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead Panel (HCYTOMAG-60K; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt,
Germany), both with using MAGPIX system (Luminex corporate, Austin, TX, USA). Serum
levels of FGF21, FGF19, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were estimated by the highly sensitive
ELISA kits (EH188RB, Invitrogen for FGF21; RD191107200R, BioVendor for FGF19; and
BMS288INST, Invitrogen for CRP) using an Epoch microplate spectrophotometer (Agilent,
Santa Clara, CA, USA).
2.2.2. Strength and Aerobic Performance Testing
The training protocol was delineated in our primary paper [28]. In order to evaluate
maximal power performance, the bench press, lat pull-down, and leg press were used as
the three exercises in a strength performance evaluation. Aerobic performance testing was
conducted by bicycle spiroergometry along with an analyzer of respiratory gases (Quark
CPET, Cosmed, Concord, CA, USA). The participants were advised to work out until they
became involuntarily exhausted and to keep their pedal cadence between 70 and 90 rpm.
According to Gordon et al., we applied a modified exercise step regimen of 0.33 W·min
−1
.
The subject’s inability to keep up a 40-rpm pedal cadence led the test to an end.
2.3. Diet Protocol
For eight weeks, subjects were randomly assigned, using an automated randomization
mechanism, to either the CKD or the RD group.  Prior to the start of the trial, subjects
were required to attend an obligatory diet consultation with a nutritionist, who gave them
thorough instructions on accurately recording their dietary food intake. The DietSystem
software was used to enter and evaluate all food record data (DietSystem App, DietSystem
App, s.r.o., Brno, Czech Republic). Detailed directions on what items would work for both
types of diets were supplied to each participant. Additionally, according to randomization,
participants undergo either an 8-week low-carb diet plan or a meal plan for a reduction diet.
Each participant’s total daily calorie intake was lowered by 500 kcal based on their lifestyle
(individually determined based on somatotype, physical activity, type of work, etc.).
Every week, a nutritionist checked on the participants’ overall diet compliance. More-
over, blood-hydroxybutyrate measurements at the completion of the research and twice-
daily urinary ketone measures were used to assess adherence to CKD.
2.3.1. Cyclical Ketogenic Reduction Diet
The CKD protocol included a five-day low-carbohydrate phase to induce and maintain
ketosis, followed by a two-day carbohydrate phase (weekends) (nutrient ratio: carbs up to
30 g; proteins 1.6 g/kg; fats: computation of energy intake to substitute carbohydrates):
(Intake of proteins 15%; carbs 8–10 g/1 kg of non–fat tissue 70%; and fat 15%).

2.3.2. Nutritionally Balanced Reduction Diet
The RD diet protocol was established on the concepts of a healthy diet (nutrient ratio
of carbohydrates 55%, fat 30%, and proteins 15% of total energy intake).
2.4. Training Protocol
The training protocol was delineated in our primary publication [28].  It consisted
of a predefined combination of resistance training to support strength skills and aerobic
training to increase endurance skills. A sport tester for aerobic performance and required
check-in procedures at a gym were used to verify training compliance (TomTom Runner
Cardio, TomTom, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).
2.5. Post-Intervention Testing
The methods used to gather data for the post-intervention testing were the same as
those used for the baseline testing. The same researcher who conducted power measure-
ments and performance testing for each subject at baseline did so to ensure reliability.
Additionally, participants took their tests at the same time each day. After data analysis,
test results were given to participants and compared to their baseline values.
2.6. Statistical Analysis
SigmaPlot 13.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis.
Normally distributed data are listed as mean±standard deviation (SD); non-parametric
data are listed as median (interquartile range). The normality of all the data was estimated
by the Shapiro–Wilk test. Intragroup differences were calculated by paired samplest-test
or Wilcoxon signed rank test (non-parametric test). Two-way repeated measures ANOVA
with Sidak’s post hoc test was utilized for testing intergroup differences. In all statistical
tests,pvalues < 0.05 were deemed significant.
3. Results
3.1. The Influence of CKD vs. RD on Anthropometric, Biochemical and Hormonal Characteristics
Anthropometric parameters of subjects on CKD or RD at baseline (V1) and after
8 weeksof diet (V2) are delineated in Table 1. No significant differences between CKD and
RD groups in anthropometric or body composition parameters were detected at baseline.
Both CKD and RD lowered body weight, body fat mass, and body mass index (BMI), with
similar effects of both diets. Lean body mass and body water content were significantly
lowered by CKD, while they were not influenced by RD (Table 1).

In the RD group, serum osteonectin concentrations significantly decreased after the
intervention, while no change in the concentrations of this myokine was found in the
CKD group. Increased levels of musclin were found at V2 in subjects from the RD group
compared to V1, while no such changes were detected in the CKD group. In contrast, the
FGF21 level significantly decreased at V2 in the CKD group while it remained unchanged in
the RD group. No significant changes in the rest of the parameters were detected (Table 3).
4. Discussion
The interactions between diet and physical activity play a major role in the long-term
regulation of body weight and physical fitness. Endocrine factors, including not only classi-
cal hormones but also adipokines, cytokines, and myokines, were shown to be very active
players in this process [10,31,32]. The aim of our study was to comprehensively analyze
the changes in body composition, physical fitness, and serum concentrations of selected
myokines and cytokines in healthy young males undergoing combined resistance/aerobic
training in combination with two dietary protocols: CKD or RD.
This study follows up on our earlier findings [28],  where eight weeks of regular
exercise training combined with either CKD or RD decreased body weight and body fat to
a similar degree, while muscle strength and endurance performance were improved only
in the RD group. These changes were seen on the background of slightly reduced lean body
mass and body water content. It was significantly reduced in CKD subjects, while RD had
no effect on it. The large decline in body water in the CKD group was most likely caused
by low carbohydrate intake-related glycogen depletion.
Myokines, muscle-secreted molecules, play a crucial role in the regulation of muscle
metabolism and function. Out of the myokine/adipokine/cytokine panel analyzed, the
serum concentrations of three myokines were affected by the intervention.  Musclin is a
peptide produced by bone and skeletal muscle cells that plays an important role in the
regulation of bone growth and physical endurance by enhancing the growth of muscle
fibers [11–13]. Given that musclin has been demonstrated to contribute to muscle growth
and regeneration [33], it is tempting to speculate that its increased concentration in the
RD group could have contributed to the increased lean body mass and improved exercise
performance detected in the RD group.   In support of this hypothesis,  musclin levels
were unchanged in the CKD group, where no changes in muscle strength or endurance
performance were detected.  Recently, it has been reported that runners with sufficient
carbohydrate intake have higher levels of musclin, which may contribute to improved
adaptations to exercise, such as improved glucose homeostasis and browning of adipose
tissue [34]. These findings are again in line with the increased musclin levels and enhanced
endurance performance observed in our RD subjects.
Osteonectin is an acidic extracellular matrix glycoprotein that plays an important
role in bone mineralization and collagen binding [
35].  In our study, serum osteonectin
levels decreased in the RD group while they remained unaffected in the CKD group.
The interconnection between osteonectin, exercise, and metabolic and energy homeostasis
regulation is still not clear. In experimental studies, osteonectin deficiency was accompanied
60

Nutrients2023,15, 1720
by an accelerated aging phenotype and reduced physical activity [36].  These changes
were attributed to reduced extracellular matrix mass and decreased collagen maturity.
In other studies, osteonectin has also been described as a metabolic enhancer of skeletal
muscle growth, with its mRNA expression being induced by exercise in both mice and
humans [37]. The reason for decreased osteonectin levels after 8 weeks of exercise in our
study is thus unclear. One possible explanation is that most of the studies published so far
were performed in rodents, which may not be representative of the regulation of osteonectin
levels in humans. Furthermore, in the human study by Aoi and colleagues [
37], osteonectin
levels were increased only when measured shortly after exercise and returned to baseline
values six hours after exercise. Therefore, as our study measured osteonectin levels in the
fasting state, we would not be able to detect any post-exercise changes in its levels.
FGF21 is a novel metabolic regulator produced primarily by the liver, but to a certain
degree also by other tissues such as white and brown adipose tissue,  skeletal muscle,
and the pancreas [38]. FGF21 has potent antidiabetic and lipid-lowering effects in animal
models of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. This hormone contributes to body weight
regulation and is strongly involved in the response to nutritional deprivation and the
ketogenic state in mice [39]. A systematic review of clinical studies exploring the effect of
exercise on FGF21 levels concluded that acute exercise tended to increase circulatory levels
of FGF21, while chronic exercise with a duration over 4 weeks had rather the opposite
effect [40]. It was also described that higher levels of daily physical activity could decrease
circulating FGF21 levels [41].  Moreover, it has been reported that carbohydrate intake
correlates with levels of FGF21 [34]. In our study, FGF21 levels decreased in the CKD group
but remained unchanged in the RD group, suggesting that the effects of the ketogenic diet
could have interacted with exercise.
In addition to the important role of myokines in the regulation of muscle regeneration
and physical performance, these molecules may also represent a promising therapeutic
target for metabolic diseases [
42].  A sedentary lifestyle without a low level of physical
activity is then directly proportional to the development of many chronic diseases accom-
panied by systemic inflammation [43,44]. Increased glucose levels in obese patients with
type 2 diabetes can disrupt the regulation of vascular tension and, among other things,
humoral and cellular inflammatory processes [45]. Several studies have confirmed the role
of ketogenic diet consumption on body weight reduction, body composition change, and
regulation of cytokine and adiponectin levels [46–50]. The lack of significant changes in
pro-inflammatory cytokines and adipokines in the CKD group in our study as compared to
its decrease in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes after the ketogenic diet may be
due to the fact that these positive effects are seen in the context of metabolic impairments
and subclinical inflammation but not in metabolically healthy lean subjects. Taken together,
the ketogenic diet and nutritionally balanced reduction diet are two different approaches
to weight loss and overall health improvement, with some overlap in their benefits but
also differences in the advantages and disadvantages of each approach (see Table 4 for
the summary).

For proper interpretation of the results of our study within the context of other pub-
lished data, it is important to consider its strengths and limitations. The randomized design
and the good compliance of the subjects to the dietary and treatment regimens are strong
points of our trial. On the other hand, the limitations include a relatively short duration, a
low number of subjects, and the inclusion of only male participants. Another limitation may
be the use of bioelectrical impedance analysis instead of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry,
which is more accurate.
5. Conclusions
Myokines play a crucial role in the communication between skeletal muscles and
other distinct organs in order to adapt whole-body metabolism to nutritional changes. Our
data suggest that changes in systemic osteonectin and musclin levels could contribute to
improved muscle strength and endurance performance in healthy young males on RD
undergoing regular resistance/aerobic training as compared to subjects on CKD, where
no improvements in muscle strength and endurance performance were detected. Further
studies with a longer duration and on a higher number of subjects are warranted to support
the validity of these findings for other populations, such as professional athletes or patients
with obesity and metabolic complications.

Abstract:Herein, we investigated the effect of fish oil supplementation combined with a strength-
training protocol, for 6 weeks, on muscle damage induced by a single bout of strength exercise in
untrained young men. Sixteen men were divided into two groups, supplemented or not with fish
oil, and they were evaluated at the pre-training period and post-training period. We investigated
changes before and 0, 24, and 48 h after a single hypertrophic exercise session. Creatine kinase (CK)
and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities, plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP)
levels, and the redox imbalance were increased in response to the single-bout session of hypertrophic
exercises at baseline (pre-training period) and decreased during the post-training period in the control
group due to the repeated-bout effect (RBE). The fish oil supplementation exacerbated this reduction
and improved the redox state. In summary, our findings demonstrate that, in untrained young men
submitted to a strength-training protocol, fish oil supplementation is ideal for alleviating the muscle
injury, inflammation, and redox imbalance induced by a single session of intense strength exercises,
highlighting this supplementation as a beneficial strategy for young men that intend to engage in
strength-training programs.

1. Introduction
Muscle damage induced by unusual eccentric exercises results in several skeletal
muscle changes, including the release of muscle enzymes into the blood, a reduction in
muscle strength, an increase in muscle soreness, and the activation of the inflammatory
process and oxidative stress [1]. Nowadays, it is known that these alterations, when well-
controlled, are required for adequate and complete muscle recovery [1]. However, when
the inflammatory response and oxidative stress are exacerbated, an imbalance occurs in
these processes, impairing or delaying muscle repair and regeneration [1,2]. This condition
also causes high ATP generation via anaerobic metabolism, muscle inflammation, and

oxidative stress.  Oxidative stress leads to a change in iron homeostasis and antioxidant
depletion, as observed by variations in the reduced: oxidized glutathione ratio [3,4]. Indirect
markers of muscle damage—e.g., the plasma activities of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) [4–6]—are frequently evaluated to monitor the efficiency and risks of
strength-training protocols in exercising subjects and athletes. Usually, the plasma activities
of these enzymes increase within 6 to 8 h after a strength exercise session, peaking between
48 and 72 h and remaining elevated for up to 7 days [5,7]. Delayed-onset muscle soreness
associated with muscle injury also peaks between 24 and 48 h post-exercise, and it is more
pronounced in non-trained individuals and older people than in high-performance strength
athletes [5,7].
After a muscle injury induced by eccentric contractions, the inflammatory response
initiates tissue repair and regeneration [1,8]. This response involves the release of cytokines,
including interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1b (IL-1b), and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-
α).  IL-6 is the main cytokine to increase after physical exercise [9,10].  These cytokines
also increase in strenuous, high-intensity, and intermittent exercises [
11,12]. These three
pro-inflammatory cytokines act on the liver, stimulating the production and release of
C-reactive protein (CRP), an indicator of systemic acute inflammation [13]. After a single
extenuating aerobic or strength exercise session, CRP plasma levels increase [14,15].
The term the “repeated-bout effect” (RBE) commonly refers to the protective adapta-
tion against muscle injury caused by an identical or a similar bout of eccentric exercises
after a single bout of eccentric exercise or after a period of strength training [16–18]. This
phenomenon has been observed in several animal and human models and usually lasts
from weeks to months [
19].  The mechanisms involved in the RBE are not entirely un-
derstood, but several theories have been proposed, including mechanical, cellular, and
neural adaptations [18,19]. Potential interventions for increasing this effect can also help to
decrease the impact of muscle damage in subjects during their training program.
Muscle disorders (e.g., lesions, oxidative stress, inflammation, and atrophy) often oc-
cur in several conditions, including in exercise-induced injuries and chronic diseases (e.g.,
obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases).
Cryotherapy [20–22]
and the administration of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents [23,24], including
omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFAs) [25–28], have been proposed to provide
a protective effect in these muscle disorders or exercise-induced muscle injury. The main
anti-inflammatoryn-3PUFAs comprise eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic
acid (DHA), which have been demonstrated to reduce plasma lipids [3,29,30], oxidative
stress conditions [31,32], insulin sensitivity [31,33,34], and inflammation [33,35]. Similar to
regular and moderate aerobic exercise,n-3PUFAs reduce fat mass [36,37] and cardiovas-
cular risks [38,39], but they do not raise physical capabilities [40] or performance [41,42].
Interestingly, when young endurance athletes are supplemented with highly purifiedn-3
PUFAs (2.1 g DHA + 240 mg EPA per day for 10 wks), they present reduced muscle damage
(plasma CK and LDH activities), inflammatory markers (plasma IL-6 and IL-1β), and
muscle soreness after an eccentric-induced muscle damage exercise session [43].
It was observed thatn-3PUFAs increase muscle strength gain in older women sub-
mitted to a strength-training program [44] or resistance exercise training [44–46]. Due to
their anti-inflammatory effects,n-3PUFAs have beneficial effects in some diseases, such as
neurodevelopmental disorders related to oxidative stress (Rett Syndrome) [47], multiple
sclerosis [48], and depression [49]. The effects of fish oil supplementation on muscle dam-
age induced by different physical exercise protocols have also been demonstrated in several
studies. Acute supplementation (3 days, 3 g per day) with krill oil (a natural source ofn-3
PUFAs) was sufficient to reduce muscle damage induced by exercise (plasma CK activity)
and malondialdehyde content, a stress oxidative marker, but it did not have a significant
effect on inflammatory cytokines in resistance-trained young men [28]. In another study,
it was observed that supplementation with fish oil for 6 wks in untrained young men
induces a reduction in oxidative stress markers (thiobarbituric-acid-reactive substances and
H
2
O
2
-induced DNA damage) after a single bout of eccentric exercise, but it did not have an
67

Nutrients2023,15, 1708
effect on muscle damage markers or muscle soreness [50]. In highly trained athletes (power
training or high-intensity interval training activities), krill oil supplementation (2.5 g per
day), for 12 weeks, was associated with reduced oxidative stress after a high-intensity
physical exercise session [51]. In untrained young men, fish oil supplementation (600 mg
EPA and 260 mg DHA per day), for 8 weeks, was able to attenuate the muscle strength loss,
range of motion, muscle soreness, and plasma IL-6 increase induced by a session of maximal
voluntary eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors [
52]. Some of these effects (the range of
motion and serum CK activity) were also observed when subjects were supplemented for a
shorter period (4 weeks) [
53]. Previously, fish oil supplementation (3 g per day) for 4 weeks
was also associated with reduced muscle soreness, an increase in plasma IL-6, and muscle
peak power after downhill running at 65% VO
2max
for 60 min [54]. In another study, it was
observed that fish oil supplementation (6 g per day, for 7 weeks) improved muscle recovery
and decreased muscle soreness after a damaging eccentric exercise session in recreationally
active participants [55]. In summary, previous studies have evaluated the modulation of
n-3PUFA supplementation on muscle injury induced by a single session of damaging
exercises in untrained and trained participants, as well as in athletes. However, there are
no studies addressing the combined effect of fish oil supplementation and strength exercise
training on muscle damage in untrained participants. Thus, our study aimed to demon-
strate the effect ofn-3PUFA supplementation in combination with a strength-training
protocol for 6 weeks on the muscle injury, inflammation, and redox balance induced by
a single bout of intense strength exercises in untrained young men. For this purpose, we
evaluated the plasma levels of cytokines and C-reactive protein, cortisol and testosterone,
the activities of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, and redox state parameters
(total iron, heme iron, reduced and oxidized glutathione, and Trolox equivalent antioxidant
capacity—TEAC).
2. Material and Methods
2.1. Participants
All experimental procedures were carried out following the approval of the Ethical
Committee for Research of the Cruzeiro do Sul University (Protocol Number: 0392009) and
performed in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. Initially, a total of 21 healthy men,
between 20 and 30 years old, were eligible to participate in the study. All participants were
classified as physically active using the International Questionnaire of Physical Activity, but
they had not engaged in any aerobic or resistance training program in the last 12 months.
In this study, we decided to investigate only young men to eliminate the influence of the
hormonal variations observed in women due to the menstrual cycle, since female hormones
have been associated with different leukocyte responses during exercise-induced muscle
injury [56]. Individuals with muscle injury, endocrine disease, and hormonal or nutritional
supplement usage were excluded from the study. The participants were randomly divided
into two groups: a control group (n = 10) and a group supplemented with fish oil, a natural
source ofn-3PUFAs (n = 11).  At the end of the experimental protocol, 2 participants
from the control group and 3 from the fish oil group were excluded from the study for
different reasons: withdrawal from participating in the study (1 from the fish oil group),
an inability to attend the strength-training protocol (at least 85% of participation; 2 from
the control group and 1 from the fish oil group), and inadequate supplementation (at least
90% adherence, as assessed by the capsule count at the end of the experimental protocol;
1 from the fish oil group).  Thus, at the end, 8 participants of each group completed the
experimental protocol, and their results were used in the analysis.
2.2. A Single Bout of a Strength Exercise Protocol
A single bout of strength exercises, consisting of 6 sets of 10 maximum repetitions,
with intervals of 1 min between sets, was applied at baseline (the pre-training period) and
after six weeks of training (the post-training period). The temporal responses (before and 0,
24, and 48 h after the single session) of muscle damage markers—the plasma activity of CK
68

Nutrients2023,15, 1708
and LDH, and the circulating concentration of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, and
IL-1β) and CRP—were monitored, according to previous studies [5,57]. Plasma cortisol
and testosterone levels were measured before and immediately after the single session of
strength exercises, and the redox parameters were only measured after 24 h.
2.3. Strength-Training Protocol
All participants were supervised by a well-experienced professional in strength train-
ing, for the whole training protocol period (6 weeks), which was performed at the Cruzeiro
do Sul University (Sao Paulo, Brazil). As an exclusion criterion, a minimum participation
of 85% was required for the entire strength-training protocol. All participants were sub-
mitted to a strength-training protocol, which comprised a daily undulating periodization
model [17] for six weeks, three times per week.  Briefly, the participants performed the
following training schedule: weeks 1, 3, and 6 (hypertrophy)—6 series of 10 repetitions
with a 1 min interval (6×10 with 1 min interval); weeks 2 and 4 (strength)—5×5 with a
3 min interval; and week 5 (resistance)—2×20 with a 1 min interval.
2.4. Supplementation with Fish Oil
Fish oil capsules were provided by the Naturalis Nutricao & Farma LTDA (Sao Paulo,
Brazil).   The  participants  received  3  capsules  of  fish  oil  per  day  as  recommended  by
the manufacturer.  As demonstrated in previous studies, nutritional intervention or fish
oil  supplementation  changes  the  fatty  acid  profile  after  a  few  weeks  [
53,58].   A  high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis for the determination of the fatty
acid profile in the fish oil capsules demonstrated that each capsule contained 260 mg EPA
and 202 mg DHA. Therefore, the daily doses ofn-3PUFAs were 780 mg of EPA and 606 mg
of DHA. The participants were supplemented for the six weeks of the daily undulating
strength training. At the end of the experimental protocol, the remaining fish oil capsules
were counted to determine the adherence of the participants to the fish oil supplementation.
One participant was excluded because he had less than 90% adherence.
2.5. Blood Collection and Plasma Separation
The participants were instructed to not eat for at least four h before blood collection for
a biochemical analysis of the plasma. The participants were instructed to have their regular
breakfast after waking up (up to 07:00–08:00 a.m.), and blood collection was performed
between 11:00 and 12:00 a.m.; therefore, all participants were in the same feeding state.
Samples were collected before and 0, 24, and 48 h after a single session of a bout of strength
exercise. After that, the blood samples were immediately processed for plasma separation,
which was aliquoted and kept at−80
◦
C until analysis.
2.6. Measurements of Plasma Cytokines and C-Reactive Protein
IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1βwere measured using a quantitative immunoassay, an Enzyme-
Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), with kits obtained from R&D System (Minneapolis,
MN, USA). The concentration of plasma CRP was determined using a commercial kit from
Bioclin (Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil) with immunoturbidimetry.
2.7. Plasma Activities of Creatine Kinase and Lactate Dehydrogenase
The activities of plasma CK and LDH were measured using a commercial kit from Bio-
clin (Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil). CK catalyzes the dephosphorylation of creatine
phosphate with the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which reacts with glucose
in hexokinase, forming glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
oxidizes G6P to 6-phosphogluconate, reducing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD
+
)
to NADH, which can be detected via spectrophotometry at 340 nm.  LDH catalyzes the
pyruvate reduction using NADH, producing lactate and NAD
+
.  The decomposition of
NADH is proportional to the enzyme activity, and it can be measured at 340 nm.

2.8. Measurements of Cortisol and Testosterone
The plasma concentrations of testosterone and cortisol were determined using ELISA,
following the specifications of the kits from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI,
USA), according to the manufactures’ instructions.
2.9. Determination of Redox State Parameters
2.9.1. Total Iron Determination
The plasma total iron concentration was determined using a kit from Doles-Bioquímica
Clínica (Goiania, Brazil). The Fe
2+
:ferrozine complex formed after reducing the ferric ions
(Fe
3+
) released from several sources during exercise was measured at 560 nm. The reducing
system comprises 0.36 M hydroxylamine chloride, 0.10 M glycine, 14 mM thiosemicar-
bazide, and 0.50 mM octylphenoxypolyetoxyethanol, at pH 2 [
59].  The specific effects
of exercise on redox parameters and background levels in rested subjects were normal-
ized to 1.0, and post-exercise values are, thus, expressed as relative values (compared
to pre-exercise values). Areas under curves were calculated between background levels
(pre-exercise) and 24 h post-exercise levels (AUCpre-24 h).
2.9.2. Heme Iron Determination
Plasma  heme  iron  (from  hemoglobin,  myoglobin,  and  other  heme  proteins)  was
assayed using a method based on heme iron oxidation by the ferricyanide anion contained
in a solution of 0.10 M KH
2
PO
4
,60mMK
3
[Fe(CN)
6
], 77 mM KCN, and 82 mM Triton
X-100.  Heme iron cyanide is stoichiometrically detected at 540 nm, using hemoglobin
as a standard curve.  The background levels in rested subjects were normalized to 1.0,
and post-exercise values are, thus, expressed as relative values (compared to pre-exercise
values). Areas under curves were calculated between background levels (pre-exercise) and
24 h post-exercise levels (AUCpre-24 h).
2.9.3. Plasma Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC)
The Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity in plasma was assayed as described by
Van den Berg et al. [60]. Briefly, a 2,2

-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate radical
solution (ABTS
−
) was prepared by mixing 2.5 mM 2,2

-azobis-(2-amidinopropane) and HCl
(ABAP) with 20 mM ABTS stock solution in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), containing
150 mM NaCl (PBS). The solution was heated for 12 min at 60
◦
C, protected from light,
and stored at room temperature, and absorbance at 734 nm should be 0.35–0.40 to ensure
sufficient ABTS—formation. Since ABTS—gradually decomposes (approximately 2% per
hour), regular blanks (in the absence of samples) were recorded for appropriate subtractions.
The background levels in rested subjects were normalized to 1.0, and post-exercise values
are, thus, expressed as relative values (compared to pre-exercise values).  Areas under
curves were calculated between background levels (pre-exercise) and 24 h post-exercise
levels (AUCpre-24 h).
2.9.4. Reduced and Oxidized Glutathione Measurements
The reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione content in plasma was measured
as described by Rahman et al.  (Rahman et al., 2006) [61].  The method is based on the
reaction of reduced thiol groups (such as in GSH) with 5,5

-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid
(DTNB) to form 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB), which is stoichiometrically detected via
absorbance at 412 nm. Purified GSH and GSSG were used as standards. The background
levels in rested subjects were normalized to 1.0, and post-exercise values are, thus, expressed
as relative values (compared to pre-exercise values). Areas under curves were calculated
between background levels (pre-exercise) and 24 h post-exercise levels (AUCpre-24 h).

3.1. Plasma Activity of Creatine Kinase and Lactate Dehydrogenase
A single bout of strength exercise increased the CK and LDH activities in the control
andn-3PUFA-fed groups at baseline (the pre-training period), as shown in Figure 1A,C,
respectively. During the post-training period, this increase was attenuated in the control
group and reduced by the fish oil supplementation. We did not find any statistical difference
using the two-way ANOVA test, but when the AUCs of the control group and the fish
oil group were compared using Student’st-test,  we observed a marked difference,  as
demonstrated in Figure 1B,D. The AUCs of the CK and LDH activities were also analyzed
using Cohen’sdeffect size; the supplemented group exhibited a higher attenuation than
the control group (effect sizes of−1.44 and−1.40, respectively). The intra-assay coefficient
of variance (CV%) was 3.6–7.0% for CK activity and 4.4–9.0% for LDH activity.

3.2. Determination of Inflammation Markers
A single bout of strength exercises increased the plasma concentrations of IL-6 and
CRP in both groups at baseline (the pre-training period). Following the strength-training
protocol (the post-training period), this increase was significantly attenuated in the control
group and exacerbated in the fish-oil-supplemented group (Figure 2A,C). No difference
was found using the two-way ANOVA test, but a marked reduction was observed when
the AUCs of the control group and the fish oil group were compared using Student’st-test,
as demonstrated in Figure 2B,D. When the AUCs of the plasma IL-6 and CRP levels were
compared using Cohen’sdeffect size, the supplemented group showed a higher reduction
than the control group (effect sizes of−1.30 and−1.21, respectively).  The linearity (r

for the IL-6 assay was 0.983. The intra-assay coefficient of variance (CV%) was 4.2–8.50%
for IL-6 and 1.1–3.9% for CRP. We did not observe any significant alteration in the plasma
IL-1b and TNF-αlevels.

3.3. Plasma Testosterone: Cortisol Ratio
The testosterone:  cortisol ratio was not significantly modified by a single bout of
strength exercises before (pre-training) and after (post-training) six weeks of the strength-
training protocol.  Fish oil supplementation did not alter this response (Figure 3).  The
linearity (r

) for the testosterone assay was 0.991, and for the cortisol assay, it was 0.966.
The intra-assay coefficient of variance (CV%) was 4.1–6.2.0% for testosterone and 3.7–8.3%
for cortisol.

3.4. Measurement of Plasma Redox Parameters
After six weeks of daily undulating strength training, it was found that fish oil sup-
plementation did not modify the plasma concentrations of iron, heme iron, and TEAC
after 24 h of a single bout of strength exercises when compared to those of the control
group, using Student’st-test. However, it significantly increased GSH and decreased GSSG
levels (effect sizes of +1.44 and−1.55, respectively) (Figure 4A). Consequently, the ratio of
GSH/GSSH was increased by fish oil supplementation (an effect size of +5.97) (Figure 4B).

4. Discussion
Various previous studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of fish oil supple-
mentation on markers of muscle injury (plasma CK and LDH activities), inflammation
(plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines), muscle soreness, and oxidative stress in-
duced by different protocols of a single bout of damaging exercises, both in untrained and
trained participants, including athletes [28,50–54]. In these studies, the participants were
supplemented with fish oil prior to a protocol of a single bout of exercise that induces
muscle damage.  The main novelty of our study is that it addresses the effect of fish oil
supplementation in combination with strength exercise training on exercise-induced muscle
damage in untrained participants.  Thus, our study is particularly important because it
demonstrates that, in untrained young men submitted to strength exercise training, fish oil
supplementation is ideal for alleviating the muscle injury, inflammation, and redox balance
induced by a single bout of intense strength exercises.
At baseline (the pre-training period),  a single bout of strength exercise increased
plasma CK and LDH activities and IL-6 and CRP concentrations,  classical markers of
muscle damage and inflammation, respectively. However, these effects were significantly
attenuated after six weeks of daily undulating training (the post-training period), demon-
strating a protective muscle adaptation to the training. The RBE occurs when the individual
presents attenuation in muscle injury, inflammation, and soreness after the same or similar
bouts of physical exercise or training over time. Thus, the RBE is an important physiological
adaptation to protect the skeletal muscle against excessive damage and inflammation, re-
ducing the soreness and muscle recovery time after successive bouts of the same or similar
physical exercise sessions or training [16–18].  Two components are mainly involved in
the RBE in our study: (i) the first bout of strength exercise and (ii) the strength training.
Regular physical training promotes anti-inflammatory and antioxidant responses [64,65],
which additionally contribute to the RBE.
After muscle damage, an adequate and well-controlled inflammatory response is re-
quired to completely restore muscle homeostasis and for recovery [1].   This response
involves  the  recruitment  of  leukocytes  into  injured  tissue  and  the  production  of  pro-
inflammatory  cytokines,  consequently  increasing  these  mediators’  local  and  systemic
concentrations [
1,10].  However, an exacerbated inflammatory response after eccentric
exercises can impair or delay muscle repair and regeneration. In our study, we observed
an increased temporal plasma release of IL-6 and CRP after a single bout of strength ex-
ercises, but there were no differences in TNF-αor IL-1βplasma concentrations. Previous
studies have also found no alterations in pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by physical
activity [5,14]. The pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, are essential for
the acute inflammatory response, as they stimulate the production of acute-phase proteins,
including CRP. This response depends on the characteristics of the physical exercise in-
volved, including the intensity, volume, and intervals among series [15,66]. Other authors
suggest that pro-inflammatory cytokines are locally produced by the exercised muscles
and released into circulation but rapidly degrade, remaining stable in plasma for a short
period [8].  These observations can explain, at least in part, our results concerning the
pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1βand TNF-α.
Supplementation withn-3PUFA additionally increased the RBE, as demonstrated by
the reduction in the plasma activities of CK and LDH and the circulating concentrations
of IL-6 and CRP. Although the mechanisms involved in the RBE are not entirely known
yet, cellular modifications may occur as a result of the fish oil supplementation, improving
the protective adaptation against muscle damage induced by strength exercises.  Some
studies suggest that the increased recruitment of sarcomeres during contraction decreases
mechanical stress, avoiding the rupture of myofibrils [67].  The reduced inflammatory
process in the participants submitted to the fish oil supplementation could further attenuate
the response induced by strength exercises.
The relationship between testosterone and cortisol in response to physical exercise
indicates physical stress or an imbalance between anabolic and catabolic processes [68,69].
76

Nutrients2023,15, 1708
We did not observe any alteration in the testosterone/cortisol ratio as a result of the strength-
training protocol or the fish oil supplementation, suggesting that our experimental protocol
could not modify physical stress or the anabolic/catabolic balance. Uchida et al. [57] evalu-
ated the influence of different intensities (50, 75, 90, and 110% of 1RM) of the bench press
exercise on the same hormones, and they also did not find any changes in the plasma con-
centrations of both steroid hormones. The authors suggested that the possible cause of this
effect was the low volume of exercise and muscle mass involved in the bench press exercise.
Crewther et al. [70] studied the impact of three different sessions of squat exercises (45%,
75%, and 88% of 1RM) on plasma testosterone and cortisol concentrations. Interestingly,
the session of 75% led to the highest increase compared to the other sessions.  Thus, the
modulation of the testosterone/cortisol ratio depends on the experimental protocol.
Several authors have used antioxidant compounds to reduce oxidative stress induced
by physical exercise [71,72], including interventions with fish oil [25–28]. Regarding redox
parameters at the end of the non-linear strength training in our study, no changes in the
plasma concentrations of iron, heme iron, and TEAC were observed as a result of the fish
oil supplementation. However, increased GSH, decreased GSSG, and consequently an in-
creased GSH/GSSG ratio were found in the supplemented group, suggesting an improved
antioxidant defense. GSH rapidly reacts nonenzymatically with reactive oxygen/nitrogen
species (ROS/RNS), including the hydroxyl radical, dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3), and per-
oxynitrite [73].  Moreover, GSH also participates in enzymatic antioxidant defense, e.g.,
as a substrate of the GPx-mediated reduction of peroxides, resulting in the production of
GSSG. The fish oil supplementation improved the GSH/GSSG antioxidant system.  An
elevated GSH/GSSG ratio is required to control the reducing environment [74]. The effects
ofn-3PUFAs and/or physical exercise might be effective under conditions of an impaired
redox balance [26], including in older people [75] and in metabolic and inflammatory
diseases [47,76].
The anti-inflammatory effect ofn-3PUFA has been demonstrated by various research
groups, and it has been related to the beneficial effects of these metabolites in different
inflammatory diseases, obesity, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular
diseases, fatty liver disease, and cancer [
77–80].  The mechanisms of action ofn-3PUFA
involve several signaling pathways, including the activation of GPR120 [81], the generation
of anti-inflammatory and/or pro-resolution lipid mediators (resolvins, protectins, and
maresins) [
82], and the reduction of pro-inflammatory lipid derivatives (prostaglandin
and thromboxane 2 series, and leukotriene 4 series) [
83].  Our group also demonstrated
thatn-3PUFA supplementation improves mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle
of an animal model of high-fat diet-induced obesity [
34].   We propose herein thatn-3
PUFA could potentialize the repeated-bout effect induced by strength training through
several actions, including (1) the anti-inflammatory effect, reducing the production of pro-
inflammatory cytokines; (2) improved mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle, decreasing
the generation of lipid derivatives and reactive oxygen species; and (3) decreased oxidative
stress, resulting in diminished muscle damage. This proposition and the main findings of
this work are summarized in Figure 5.
Our study is the first to demonstrate the beneficial effects of fish oil supplementation in
combination with a strength-training protocol for 6 weeks on the muscle damage markers,
inflammation, and redox imbalance induced by a single bout of strength exercises.  It is
important to describe some of the limitations of our study. First, we investigated the effects
ofn-3PUFAs and strength training for a short period (6 weeks); further studies are required
to evaluate the effects for longer periods. Second, we assessed the adherence to the fish oil
supplementation only by counting the remaining fish oil capsules at the end of the experi-
mental protocol; a direct measurement (e.g., the determination of plasma fatty acid profiles)
is lacking.  Third, we analyzed only young men; further studies are required to analyze
young women at different phases of the menstrual cycle and other groups of participants,
including older people. Lastly, we used a small sample size (n = 8 per group), which could
have reduced the statistical power of our analysis. However, the Cohen’sdeffect size values
77

Nutrients2023,15, 1708
of our data (d> 1.0) suggest a large effect of the fish oil supplementation. In addition, the
effects of fish oil supplementation on exercise-induced muscle injury were also observed in
previous studies that used a similar number of participants (
n = 7–11 per group) to demon-
strate the effects of the supplementation [53–55]. Thus, based on the findings of previous
studies, the well-controlled strength-training protocol that we used, and the Cohen’sd
effect size values that we found, our results seem to be statistically representative.

In summary,  supplementation withn-3PUFAs improved the RBE and redox pa-
rameters in healthy young men submitted to daily undulating training for six weeks,
as demonstrated by the decreased muscle damage (plasma activities of CK and LDH),
pro-inflammatory markers (IL-6 and CRP), and redox biomarkers (increased GSH/GSSG
ratio) after a bout of strength exercises. Thus, our study is of particular interest because
it demonstrates that, in untrained young men submitted to a strength-training protocol,
fish oil supplementation is ideal for alleviating the muscle injury, inflammation, and redox
imbalance induced by a single session of intense strength exercise. Our findings highlight
fish oil supplementation as an effective nutritional strategy to reduce the muscle damage,
inflammation, and redox imbalance in untrained individuals who intend to engage in
strength-training programs. Further studies are necessary to determine the persistence of
this modulation for prolonged training periods and the effects of fish oil supplementation
combined with strength exercise training in other groups of participants, including young
women and older people.

Abstract:Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients manifest muscle dysfunction and
impaired muscle oxidative capacity, which result in reduced exercise capacity and poor health status.
This study examined the effects of 12-week eccentric (ECC) and concentric (CONC) cycling training
on plasma markers of cardiometabolic health, oxidative stress, and inflammation in COPD patients.
A randomized trial in which moderate COPD was allocated to ECC (n= 10; 68.2±10.0 year)or
CONC (
n= 10; 71.1±10.3 year) training groups.  Participants performed 12-week ECC or CONC
training, 2–3 sessions per week, 10 to 30 min per session.  Before and after training, peak oxygen
consumption, maximal power output (VO
2peak
and PO
max
),  and time-to-exhaustion (TTE) tests
were performed.  Plasma antioxidant and oxidative markers, insulin resistance, lipid profile, and
systemic inflammation markers were measured before and after training at rest.  VO
2peak
,PO
max
and TTE remained unchanged after ECC and CONC. CONC induced an increase in antioxidants
(p= 0.01), while ECC decreased antioxidant (p= 0.02) markers measured at rest. CONC induced lesser
increase in oxidative stress following TTE (p= 0.04), and a decrease in insulin resistance (p= 0.0006)
compared to baseline.  These results suggest that CONC training induced an increase in insulin
sensitivity, antioxidant capacity at rest, and lesser exercise-induced oxidative stress in patients with
moderate COPD.

1. Introduction
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by airflow limitation
associated with inflammation of the airway [1]. A common extra-pulmonary manifestation
of patients with COPD is skeletal muscle dysfunction,  which is evidenced mainly by
reduced muscle endurance and strength of the lower limbs [2]. Impaired muscle oxidative
capacity, a shift toward a glycolytic muscle fiber type distribution, reduced capillarity, and
reduced cross-sectional area of muscle fiber led to muscle dysfunction in COPD patients [2].
The reduced exercise capacity and increased fatigability are clinical manifestations that
exacerbate poor health status and limit daily life activities in COPD patients [
3].  The
limited exercise capacity of these individuals also predisposes them to develop impaired
metabolism of glucose and lipids, which may lead to metabolic syndrome [4].  Airway
inflammation releases inflammatory molecules into the bloodstream, thus, COPD patients
show evidence of an increased level of systemic inflammation chronically [2]. It has been

Nutrients2023,15, 908
shown that inflammation can increase muscle degradation,  inhibiting muscle-specific
protein expression, and increasing muscle cell apoptosis, worsening muscle dysfunction in
COPD patients [5]. Thus, systemic inflammation has been proposed as a mechanism in the
development of muscle dysfunction in COPD patients as interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1
beta (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) have been shown to be elevated
in these patients [
6]. Based on the evidence, it is accepted that COPD patients also have
elevated levels of oxidative stress due to the imbalance between the generation of reactive
oxygen  species  (ROS)  and  the  efficiency  of  the  antioxidant  mechanism  [7].   All  these
manifestations affect skeletal muscle function and further worsen muscle dysfunction.
Thus, searching for new rehabilitation strategies to reduce muscle dysfunction within the
burden of this disease is necessary.
Several studies have shown that exercise training is the cornerstone of pulmonary
rehabilitation as it markedly improves functional performance, muscle mass, and exercise
capacity in COPD patients [8–10]. Endurance exercise training is the most common exercise
modality prescribed in COPD [
11–13], which has been shown to improve exercise tolerance
and muscle oxidative capacity in these patients [12,14–16]. However, endurance training
could also increase oxidative stress levels in severe COPD patients [17], which may not
be desirable as it could impair skeletal muscle function.  In contrast, another novel and
less explored exercise training modality is eccentric cycling training. This type of training
is characterized by eccentric contractions of the lower limb muscles that are performed
when resisting the backward rotational movement of the cranks generated by an eccentric
ergometer. Notably, eccentric cycling imposes lesser cardiopulmonary, metabolically, and
perceptual demands (i.e., lower oxygen consumption, dyspnea, and blood pressure) than
concentric cycling, making it safer for COPD patients [18]. Interestingly, eccentric cycling
can produce a greater workload for the same metabolic demand than concentric cycling
in COPD patients [
18,19].   Furthermore,  eccentric cycling training has been shown to
increase muscle strength and mass to a greater extent than concentric cycling in moderate
COPD patients [19,20],  and a decrease (20%) in the homeostasis model assessment of
insulin  resistance  index  (HOMA-IR)  after  12  weeks  of  continuous  moderate-intensity
eccentric cycling training [
21].   Notably,  these benefits were reported despite ~30-50%
lesser cardiovascular strain and metabolic cost than conventional concentric cycling [21].
Interestingly, we have recently shown that oxidative stress levels (i.e., thiobarbituric acid
reactive substances; TBARS) decreased after one acute bout of eccentric cycling at moderate
intensity [22].  Hence, eccentric cycling training could be an ideal exercise modality for
COPD patients. However, the long-term effects of eccentric cycling training on oxidative
stress and inflammation in COPD patients have not been explored yet.
Interestingly, exercise training in COPD patients has been shown to producepositive [23],
null [24], or negative changes in oxidative stress assessed at rest [25]. Discrepancies among
studies may be due to differences in exercise prescription and heterogenicity of patients’
severity.  However, it is possible that in rest conditions, the oxidative molecules are not
produced/released, and the antioxidant capacity is not fully displayed, hence, no changes
have been observed.  A single bout of exercise has been shown to induce exaggerated
production of ROS and oxidative damage in COPD patients when exercise exceeds a certain
intensity or duration [26]. Thus, it seems plausible to assess the oxidative and antioxidant
response to an acute bout of exercise to dynamically assess oxidative stress handling in
COPD patients. However, this has not been explored yet. There are tests that are used to
evaluate exercise tolerance, such as time-to-exhaustion tests (TTE) [27]. Specifically, TTE
consists of the patient sustaining a fixed workload for the longest time possible, which has
been used in COPD patients [28].  However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has
examined oxidative stress and antioxidant markers after TTE in COPD patients after an
intervention of exercise training. Therefore, as oxidative stress has been involved in muscle
mass loss and dysfunction in COPD patients [29,30], assessing oxidative stress changes
after TTE in COPD patients could shed light on exercise-induced oxidative stress handling
in these patients.

Thus, this study aimed to examine the effects of 12 weeks of eccentric (ECC) and con-
ventional concentric (CONC) cycling training on markers of oxidative stress, inflammation,
and cardiometabolic health in COPD patients measured at rest. Furthermore, as oxidative
stress could be induced by acute exercise, we compared the changes in oxidative stress
markers following a standardized submaximal exercise between ECC and CONC, before
and after training in COPD patients.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants
This study is part of a larger study, further details of participants and training inter-
ventions have been published elsewhere [19]. In brief, it was a randomized prospective
training study, in which twenty participants with moderate COPD (10 men and 10 women)
volunteered to participate. Participants were diagnosed as moderate COPD patients ac-
cording to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD; II) based on
a pulmonologist assessment and spirometry tests. The sample size was estimated based
on a reduction of 8.8% in total cholesterol levels after eccentric training (effect size of 1.5)
reported in a previous study [31]. Considering an alpha level of 0.05 and a statistical power
of 0.8, the sample size estimation revealed that eight participants per group would be
sufficient (G * Power 3.1, Germany). Ten participants per group were included to account
for a 20% dropout.
The exclusion criteria considered supplemental oxygen therapy, kidney, neurologic or
cardiovascular disease, recent exacerbation with three or more days of steroid or antibiotic
use, being part of strength or aerobic training in the last year; musculoskeletal injury of
the legs during the past one year, and smoking in the last six months. Participants were
instructed to refrain from other types of training and from any nutritional supplementation
and to maintain regular daily routines during the study period. Written informed consent
was obtained from all participants.  The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics
Committee and Eastern Metropolitan Health Service of the city (clinical trial registration
number: DRKS00009755) and conducted according to the Helsinki declaration.
2.2. Study Design
Participants were allocated to ECC (men: 6, women: 4) or CONC (men: 4, women: 6),
using a stratified randomized allocation scheme considering FEV
1
and age to be similar
between groups. The physical characteristics of the participants are presented in the Results.
All testing was completed in the laboratory at room temperature (20–22
◦
C) at the same
time of day (±1 h). Participants were asked not to consume caffeine and alcohol for at least
3 h and 24 h, respectively.
Outcome measurements were collected 72 h before and after 12 weeks of ECC and
CONC training. Participants were cited to the laboratory on two different days to complete
all assessments. On day one, an incremental cycling test was performed to determine peak
oxygen consumption (VO
2peak
) and maximal concentric power output (PO
max
).  Forty-
eight hours after, participants returned to the laboratory, and blood was withdrawn from
the  antecubital  vein  was  collected  at  rest  after  12  h  of  fasting.   Furthermore,  another
blood sample was collected following a time-to-exhaustion cycling test (TTE). Participants
received a light breakfast consisting of a cereal bar (78.4 kCal of energy;  1.1 g protein,
2.5 total fat, 13 g carbohydrate) and a milk box (40 kCal of energy; 0 g protein, 0 total fat,
8gcarbohydrate) after the first blood withdraw at rest. Immediately following the TTE a
second blood sample was collected to determine the changes (Δ: Post-TTE—Pre-TTE) in
plasma oxidative stress markers to determine exercise-induced oxidative stress.
2.3. Exercise Training
Participants attended four sessions before the commencement of the training to fa-
miliarize patients with exercise. During familiarization sessions, eccentric or concentric
cycling was performed (5–20 min) at ~25% of their self-perceived maximum effort. After
87

Nutrients2023,15, 908
this, participants performed eccentric or concentric cycling training for 12 weeks with a
total number of training sessions of 34.  Training frequency started with two times per
week, on weeks 1–2, and progressed to three times per week from weeks 3 to 12. Training
intensity was moderate and increased from 11 to 13 on the rating of perceived exertion
(RPE) from a 6-20 Borg’s scale.  Training time started from 10 min in week 1 to 30 min
in week 12.  Training total workload was different between CONC and ECC as for the
same RPE, the ECC training group performed a much higher training average workload
ECC = 226.6±101.9 vs. CONC = 78.1±62.7 kJ;p≤0.05). The CONC group trained in a
conventional concentric recumbent cycle ergometer (Livestrong, LS 5.0R model, Austin, TX,
USA). The ECC group trained in a recumbent eccentric cycle ergometer (Eccentric Trainer,
Metitur, Finland) in which participants were instructed to resist the backward movements
of the cranks, which is known to induce eccentric contractions of the knee extensor muscles
mainly. All training sessions were performed in an airconditioned laboratory (temperature:
20–21
◦
C, relative humidity:  50%).  Exercise training protocol induced changes in body
composition and functional performance markers after training, which have been published
previously elsewhere [19].
2.4. Measurements
2.4.1. Maximal Incremental Cycling Test
On day one, patients performed a maximal incremental test on an electromagnetically
braked ergometer (Livestrong, LS 5.0 R model, Austin, TX, USA). The test started at10 W
for two minutes, with 10 W increase every minute until voluntary exhaustion or until
the patients were unable to maintain 60 revolutions per minute of cadence [
18]. Oxygen
consumption (VO
2
) and carbon dioxide production (VCO
2
) were assessed using a breath-
by-breath gas analyzer (Ergocard, Medisoft, Belgium). PO
max
and VO
2peak
were obtained
as described in previous study [32].
2.4.2. Time-to-Exhaustion Test (TTE)
On day two, a constant power output time-to-exhaustion cycling test was performed
at 75% of PO
max
[33]. Participants were instructed to adopt their preferred cadence between
60 and 90 rpm and maintain the target power output for as long as possible. Verbal encour-
agement was provided; however, participants were not given feedback on their elapsed
time or power output. The participants’ TTE was reached when despite encouragement,
their cadence fell 10 rpm below 60 rpm for 10 s or more.  The TTE was recorded to the
nearest second. Total work was calculated by multiplying time by average power output
and expressed in kJ [27].
2.4.3. Blood Samples
As mentioned above, an initial blood sample was obtained from the antecubital vein
following a 12 h overnight fast at rest before and 72 h after the last training session. Addi-
tionally, a second blood sample was collected following (~5 min) the TTE. Blood samples
were collected in Vacutainer©EDTA tubes for plasma and tubes with pro-coagulant(10 mL)
for serum. Tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 4
◦
C and 4000 rpm. Plasma and serum were
aliquoted in Eppendorf tubes with 500μL of sample and stored at−80
◦
C until analyzed.
2.4.4. Oxidative Stress and Inflammatory Markers
Oxidative stress and inflammatory markers were analyzed by ELISA or colorimet-
ric kits (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and read on a plate reader
(Multiskan FC, Thermo Scientific, Beijing, China).  All measurements were performed
in plasma or serum samples according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Interleukin 6
(IL-6), tumor necrosis factor
α(TNF-α), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), total antioxidant ca-
pacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), thiobarbituric acid reactive
substances (TBARS) and glutathione peroxidase activity (GPx) were analyzed at rest (pre-
TTE). Changes (Δ: Post-Pre) in these markers after TTE were also determined (TACTTE,
88

Nutrients2023,15, 908
SODTTE, CATTTE, TBARSTTE, GPxTTE). All samples were analyzed in duplicate.  Co-
efficient of variation of duplicates were:  IL-6:  5.2
±5.0%, TNF-α:  21.5±18.4%, IL-1β:
21.9±26.8%,TAC: 9.8±7.2%, SOD: 5.6±7.9%, CAT: 4.4±3.6%, TBARS: 3.1±3.7%, and
GPx: 4.4±3.4%.
2.4.5. Cardiometabolic Health Markers
Insulin Sensitivity
Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration was measured using an enzymatic method
(Trinder, Genzyme Diagnostics, Charlottetown, Canada) and plasma insulin was assessed
using a radioimmune assay (DPC, Houston, TX, USA). Homeostatic model assessment
insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated according to Matthew’s equation [34]. Whole-
blood glycosylated hemoglobin (%Hb1ac) was measured using a latex immunoturbidimet-
ric assay in a DCA analyzer (Siemens Medical, Devault, PA, USA).
Lipid Profile
Total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TAG) concentrations were analyzed by enzy-
matic methods using standard kits (Wiener Lab Inc., Rosario, Argentina) in an automatic
analyzer (Metrolab 2 300 Plus™, Metrolab Biomed Inc., Rosario, Argentina). Plasma high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels were measured by the same enzymatic method
after phosphotungstate precipitation.  Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) levels
were calculated using the Friedewald formula.
2.5. Statistical Analysis
The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess the distribution of the data as a whole
deviates from a comparable normal distribution, and the analysis showed that all dependent
variables were normally distributed. Baseline characteristics between groups were analyzed
by Studentttest. Changes in the dependent variables from the baseline to post-training
were compared between the ECC and CONC groups by a two-way repeated measure
analysis of variance. If a significant interaction (group×time) effect, was found a Fisher ’s
least significance difference (LSD) post hoc test was used.  The Mann–Whitney test was
used to compare the percentage of change in oxidative stress variables and cardiometabolic
health markers. Statistical significance was set atp≤0.05, and data are presented as mean
and standard deviation (mean±SD). All statistical analyses were performed using PRISM
8.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA).

3.4.1. At Rest
As shown in Figure 2A, TAC concentration at rest showed a 137.9±162.4% increase
after CONC training (time effect,p= 0.004; training effect,p= 0.6; interaction effect,p= 0.02).
Moreover, GPx activity decreased by 17.2±20.8% after ECC training (time effect,p= 0.3;
training effect,p= 0.9; interaction effect,p= 0.03) as shown in Figure 2C. In addition, the
percentages of changes from baseline in both oxidative stress markers were statistically
different as shown in Figure 2B (TAC,p= 0.01) and Figure 2D (Gpx activity,p= 0.02). Other
oxidative stress markers measured at rest (Figure 2E–J) remained unchanged after ECC
and CONC training: TBARS (time effect,p= 0.6; training effect,p= 0.1; interaction effect,
p= 0.8), SOD (time effect,p= 0.1; training effect,p= 0.2; interaction effect,p= 0.5) and CAT
(time effect,p= 0.9; training effect,p= 0.1; interaction effect,p= 0.5).
3.4.2. Submaximal Cycling
Changes in oxidative markers following TTE are shown in Figure 3. Oxidative stress
values obtained were normalized by workload performance on the TTE of each patient
in kJ. Absolute value changes in TAC
TTE
were similar after ECC and CONC training (time
effect,p= 0.5; training effect,p= 0.9; interaction effect,p= 0.4; Figure 3A) and no differences
were found in the percentages of change from baseline in any group (p= 0.5; Figure 3B).
Changes in absolute values of GPx

of TBARS
TTE
decreased 244.8±566.5% only after CONC training (p= 0.04; Figure 3E),
but no difference was found in the percentage of change from baseline between groups in
this marker (p= 0.5; Figure 3F). No significant changes in absolute values were found in
SOD

4. Discussion
This study aimed to examine the effects of eccentric cycling (ECC) and conventional
concentric cycling (CONC) training on plasma markers of oxidative stress, systemic in-
flammation, and cardiometabolic health in patients with moderate chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD). The main findings of this study were:  (1) maximal aerobic
capacity and time-to-exhaustion (TTE) performance were maintained after 12 weeks of
ECC and CONC training;  (2) CONC induced an increase in total antioxidant capacity
(TAC) and ECC induced a decrease in GPx activity at rest; (3) exercise-induced oxidative
stress (i.e., TBARS) showed a smaller increase after CONC training; (4) insulin sensitivity
and HDL were improved after CONC training only.  Thus, our initial hypothesis was
supported as CONC training induced greater improvements in oxidative stress at rest and
after exercise, and cardiometabolic health markers changed more favorably after CONC
training compared with ECC, while inflammatory markers remained unchanged after both
training interventions.
We found that neither ECC nor CONC training improved maximal aerobic capacity
(VO
2peak
) or time-to-exhaustion test (TTE) performance (Figure 1). COPD patients manifest
pulmonary parenchyma fibrosis, airway remodeling, and dynamic hyperinflation, which
may interfere with oxygen exchange [35].   Therefore,  it is possible that no changes in
oxygen consumption observed in these patients [
20,36], were possibly due to the same
reasons that the performance in the TTE test was also not changed after CONC or ECC.
However, Porszasz et al. reported that endurance training (35 min per session at 75% of the
peak work rate attained on incremental test) induced a 20% increase in PO
max
, which was
accompanied by an increase in TTE performance [37]. These equivocal results in endurance
performance may be due to the large heterogeneity in the primary factors (i.e., ventilatory
response, dynamic hyperinflation) affecting exercise tolerance in COPD patients [38]. It
is also possible that our training interventions were not sufficiently intense stimuli as to
induce aerobic adaptations compared with previous study [37]. Mechanisms underpinning
the absence of aerobic adaptations in this population may warrant further research.
Increased serum TBARS levels and reduced GPx activity have been associated with
the  disease  severity  of  COPD  patients  [39].   We  found  that  CONC  training  induced
137.9±162.4%increase in TAC concentration (Figure 2A), while ECC training induced
17.2±20.8% decrease in GPx activity (Figure 2C,D) measured at rest in moderate COPD
patients. Equivocal results have been published previously. For instance, Rabinovich et al.
showed that COPD patients decreased their antioxidant capacity after 8 weeks of concen-
tric high-intensity interval training (HIIT), while healthy sedentary individuals increased
their muscle antioxidant markers (i.e., glutathione levels; GSH). Interestingly, Zarrindast
et al. showed that an 8-week moderate endurance training reduced lipid peroxidation (i.e.,
8-iso PGF 2α), and increased TAC levels in elderly women [40].  It has been speculated
that after regular training, there is an upregulation of the antioxidant enzymatic systems
as an adaptive response.  Specifically, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and
glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity act synergistically with non-enzymatic antioxidants
to reduce the total antioxidant capacity. However, we did not observe changes in SOD and
CAT concentrations in plasma, which is similar to Shin et al. which showed maintenance
in TBARS levels and SOD activities at rest after 6 months of moderate endurance training,
while GPx activity increased by 12% after training [41]. Interestingly, the same study re-
ported that TBARS levels tended to increase (p= 0.052) in the control group after 6 months
of endurance training in middle age obese women. Equivocal results regarding changes
in oxidant and antioxidant agents in plasma after training interventions could be due to
the heterogeneity in the disease severity of COPD patients. Overall, our results reveal that
12 weeks of moderate-intensity continuous endurance concentric training (CONC) may
have positively changed the non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity and have maintained the
TBARS levels of COPD patients at rest.
In our study, the TTE test was used to assess endurance capacity, and to induce a
standardized (75% of individual PO
max
) physiological challenge to COPD patients to assess
95

Nutrients2023,15, 908
the response to exercise-induced oxidative stress before and after training interventions.
Our results showed that the increase in TBARS levels following TTE was significantly
smaller after CONC training (Figure 3E). Mercken et al.  reported that COPD patients
have elevated systemic and pulmonary oxidative stress at rest and in response to acute
exercise compared with age-matched healthy control individuals [42]. This may suggest
that healthy individuals can tolerate exercise-induced oxidative stress more effectively than
COPD patients.  Mercken et al.  also showed for the first time that intensive supervised
pulmonary rehabilitation (8-week training program) decreased exercise-induced oxidative
stress following submaximal exercise [42].  This improved redox handling after exercise
could be attributable to adaptive responses involving more efficient muscle oxidative
metabolism (e.g., lesser mitochondrial ROS production) or a better capacity of endogenous
antioxidant systems to handle oxidative stress. However, it is still not known if the systemic
increase in oxidative stress markers in COPD patients is a reversible process and whether
other exercise interventions could also modify this scenario as it has been shown to occur
in other metabolic and cardiovascular diseases [43].
Systemic  inflammatory  markers  were  unchanged  after  ECC  and  CONC  training
(Figure 4). These results are similar to previous reports, in which circulating pro-inflammatory
cytokines were unchanged in COPD patients regardless of endurance or strength-based
training interventions [15,44]. Greater intensity and longer interventions may be necessary
to modify inflammatory markers in this population.
We found a 30.8±22.9% decrease in HOMA-IR (p= 0.0006) only after CONC train-
ing (Figure 5A,B). This result becomes relevant considering that our COPD patients had
elevated baseline HOMA-IR index (ECC: 2.6±1.2; CONC: 4.1±2.3), suggesting insulin
resistance [34]. Changes observed after CONC training were similar to the 20.4% decrease
in HOMA-IR reported by Matos et al. after eight weeks of HIIT (at 80–110% of PO
max
)in
obese patients with insulin resistance [45]. We have also previously shown similar decreases
in HOMA-IR (–50%) after 12 weeks of concentric HIIT (at 70–100% maximum heart rate) in
the same patients [46]. These positive changes induced by CONC training in the present
study may be attributable to increases in skeletal muscle oxidative enzymes, mitochondrial
biogenesis and glucose transporters induced by endurance exercise training [47]. The lack
of changes after ECC training may be related to lesser metabolic demand imposed by
eccentric contractions, which did not stimulate the skeletal muscle oxidative pathways and
thus, no changes in oxidative capacity and cardiometabolic health markers were induced.
Although reductions in circulating lipids have been previously reported after eccen-
tric training [31,48–53], we found no change in lipid profile markers after ECC training
(Figure 6). An association has been observed between the magnitude of muscle damage
induced by the eccentric contractions and changes in circulating lipids after eccentric
training [54], so we speculate that the familiarization period and gradual increase in train-
ing workload in ECC may have avoided muscle damage. This could explain the lack of
changes in lipid profile markers in the present study in comparison to previous eccentric
training studies [31,48–53]. Interestingly, we found a tendency to increase HDL (p= 0.06)
after CONC training (Figure 6F). For instance, Sillanpää et al.  reported that endurance
training (21 weeks) decreased total cholesterol (–5.6%), LDL (–5.4%), and TAG (–10.0%),
without changes in HDL in healthy middle-aged men [55]. More recently, Boukabous et al.
showed that endurance training (45 min per session at 55% heart rate reserve, 8 weeks)
decreased LDL (–17.6%), and increased HDL (+7.6%) in older women [
56].  Therefore,
although both training programs (CONC and ECC) were performed at similar perceptual
intensity (RPE of 11–13) and ECC performed ~3-fold greater workload than CONC, CONC
showed larger improvements in markers of cardiometabolic health compared to ECC.
However, lipid profile and insulin sensitivity changes reported in this study seem smaller
compared to previous studies, which may be due to the lower training intensity (RPE = 13)
of both interventions. Further studies should implement higher intensity and prolonged
(more than 12 weeks) training interventions in order to induce greater cardiometabolic risk
marker changes in COPD patients.

Nutrients2023,15, 908
We acknowledge the limitations of our study. First, high variability in the outcome
parameters may be due to differences in the severity of the disease of our patients; as we
used patients with moderate COPD, this category may be too wide in symptoms and muscle
dysfunction degrees, which increased variability.  However, a stratified randomization
was performed to distribute the participant in order to minimize this effect.  Second, a
small sample size was also recruited for this study, which also could have affected the
variability of the results. Third, although all participants were diagnosed with moderate
COPD, different clinical phenotypes exist [57]. It has been observed that emphysema and
bronchiolitis can largely differ among patients of the same severity, which is evidenced
by different levels of dyspnea while spirometric values are similar. The heterogeneity of
the sample could have been reduced if more comprehensive inclusion criteria were used,
e.g., exacerbation/hospitalizations per year. Finally, other factors such as daily physical
activity and nutrition were not controlled and could have affected the results. Thus, our
results need to be analyzed with caution as larger sample size clinical trials are needed to
extrapolate these results to the general population.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, moderate-intensity continuous concentric cycling training was more
efficient to increase antioxidant capacity (enzymatic and non-enzymatic components) at
rest and to improve exercise-induced oxidative stress control. Furthermore, it improved
insulin sensitivity and HDL levels in moderate COPD patients to a greater extent than
eccentric cycling training. Thus, moderate-intensity continuous concentric cycling training
could be prescribed to reduce oxidative stress and improve markers of cardiometabolic
health in comparison to eccentric cycling, which may be more indicated to increase muscle
mass and functional performance [19]. Further research should focus on a combination of
both concentric and eccentric cycling to target muscle dysfunction in COPD patients.

Abstract:Inadequate nutrient availability has been demonstrated to be one of the main factors related
to endocrine and metabolic dysfunction. We investigated the role of inadequate nutrient intakes in
the myokine levels of runners. Sixty-one amateur runners participated in this study. The myokine
levels were determined using the Human Magnetic Bead Panel from plasma samples collected before
and after the marathon. Dietary intake was determined using a prospective method of three food
records.  The runners with lower carbohydrate and calcium intakes had higher percentages of fat
mass (p< 0.01). The runners with a sucrose intake comprising above 10% of their energy intake and
an adequate sodium intake had higher levels of BDNF (p= 0.027 andp= 0.031). After the race and
in the recovery period, the runners with adequate carbohydrate intakes (g/kg) (>5 g/kg/day) had
higher levels of myostatin and musclin (p< 0.05). The runners with less than 45% of carbohydrate of
EI had lower levels of IL-15 (p= 0.015) and BNDF (p= 0.013). The runners with higher cholesterol
intakes had lower levels of irisin (p= 0.011) and apelin (p= 0.020), and those with a low fiber intake
had lower levels of irisin (p= 0.005) and BDNF (p= 0.049). The inadequate intake influenced myokine
levels, which promoted cardiometabolic tissue repair and adaptations to exercise.
Keywords:nutrition; exercise; endurance; musculoskeletal; physiology
1. Introduction
Exercise promotes the release of chemical messengers as a result of skeletal muscle
contraction, called myokines and/or exerkines.  The myokines modulate muscle mass,
function, and regeneration by acting on protein synthesis, insulin sensitivity, fat oxidation,
myogenesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, autophagy, mitophagy, and the remodeling of the
extracellular matrix [1–4].
In addition, many myokines seem to contribute to cardiometabolic adaptations to exer-
cise as a result of crosstalk with adipose tissues, the liver and heart contributing to glucose
homeostasis, the browning of white adipose tissue (WAT), and cardioprotection [1,5–7].
More than 650 myokines have been described in response to exercise,  and many
researchers have been investigating their biological effects on different tissues. The most
studied myokines include IL-6, IL-15, myostatin, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), secreted
protein acidic rich in cysteine (SPARC), myonectin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1
(MCP1), irisin, apelin, decorin, musclin, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-21, follistatin (FSTL),
meteorin-like (Metrnl), fractalkine, and angiopoietin-like protein 4 [2,3,8]. The myokine
levels are dependent on various forms of exercise and training [9].
Nutritional interventions such as caloric restriction or supplementation seem to modu-
late cytokines, adipokines, myokines, and cardiomiokynes [4,10,11]. Previous studies have

reported a poor daily intake with low carbohydrate, dietary fiber source, fruit, dairy bever-
age, and vegetable intake in endurance runners [12–15]. Chronic low or higher nutrient
availability promotes endocrine and cardiometabolic dysfunction [5,10].
Inadequate daily intake (DI) may influence the myokine response induced by en-
durance exercise, affecting the dynamics of muscle repair and cardiometabolic adaptations.
The maladaptive response after endurance exercise may impair muscle function, perfor-
mance, and health, or even increase the risk of acute cardiovascular events [16]
The aim of this study to investigate the effects of chronic low or high nutrient intakes
on myokine levels before and after endurance exercise.
2. Material and Methods
2.1. Subjects
Seventy-four amateur Brazilian male marathon finishers (aged 30 to 55 years) partici-
pated in this study. The volunteer recruitment was performed by e-mail to all marathon
runners registered in the São Paulo International Marathon in 2017 or 2018. Researchers
randomly contacted volunteers to confirm their interest and availability to participate in all
steps of the study (before the race, immediately after the race, and in the recovery period).
Inclusion criteria were training more than 30 km per week and having previously partici-
pated in a half marathon or marathon, as well as not having cardiovascular, pulmonary, or
kidney injury, and/or liver, kidney, inflammatory, or neoplastic diseases, or use alcohol or
drugs.
The Ethics Committee of Cruzeiro do Sul University, Brazil (Permit Number: 3.895.058)
approved this study in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All volunteers read
and signed the written informed consent document before starting to participate in the
study.
Body composition, cardiopulmonary function, and DI were evaluated before the race.
Of the seventy-four marathon runners, sixty filled in three food records before the marathon
race (one week) for DI analyses. Therefore, we excluded fourteen runners from the analysis
of the association between myokines and DI.
The São Paulo International Marathon began at 07:30 a.m. on 9 April 2017 and 8 April
2018. Fluid ingestion was provided during the race (water every 2 to 3 km; sports drinks at
12 km, 21.7 km, 33 km, and 42 km; and a carbohydrate at 28.8 km). The weather during the
race was temperate (average temperature and humidity 19.8
◦
C, 72.8% in 2017, and 19.9
◦
C,
87.7% in 2018) (National Institute of Meteorology, Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and
Supply).
An electronic digital scale platform (marte
®
, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil) was used to measure
body mass (kg) and height (cm). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated according to the
International Society for Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK) standard [weight
(kg)/height (m
2
)].   The  body  composition  was  determined by  bioimpedance  analysis
(Biodynamics Corporation, Shoreline (WA), USA, 310e) 24 h before the marathon race in
the fasting state.
2.2. Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test
After the medical history data collection, the cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET)
was realized between three and one week before the São Paulo International Marathon by
a progressive treadmill test with a constant incline of 1%, and an initial speed of 8 km·h
−1
,
with an elevation of 1 km·h
−1
every 1 min until voluntary exhaustion (TEB Apex 200, TEB,
São Paulo, Brazil, speed 0–24 km/h, grade 0–35%). The volunteers were monitored with a
standard 12-lead computerized electrocardiogram during the test (TEB
®
, ECG São Paulo,
Brazil) to rule out any cardiac dysfunction at rest and during exertion. The respiratory gas
exchange was measured through open-circuit and automatic, indirect calorimetry (Quark
CPET, COSMED
®
, Rome, Italy). The VO2 max of the subjects was determined according
to the American College of Sports Medicine [17]. All volunteers finished the International
Marathon of São Paulo in 2017 (40 runners) and 2018 (34 runners).

2.3. Blood Sampling
Blood samples (10 mL) were collected 24 h before, and 24 h and 72 h after the race from
the antecubital vein at the Cruzeiro do Sul University with at least 12 h without physical
activity and from fasting runners.  To obtain plasma samples, vacuum tubes containing
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (10 mL, EDTA, 1 mg/mL) samples were immediately
centrifuged at 4
◦
C, 400×gfor 10 min and then stored at−80
◦
C for the later analysis of
myokines at University of São Paulo. Immediately after the race, blood samples (10 mL)
from the fed runners were maintained on ice for approximately2hattheInternational
Marathon of São Paulo (competition venue, close to finish line) and then sent to Cruzeiro
do Sul University (10 mL) for plasma collection as described above.
2.4. Determination of Myokines
Apelin, BDNF, FSTL, FGF-21, IL-6, IL-15, irisin, myostatin, and musclin plasmatic
levels were evaluated using the MILLIPLEX
®
Human Myokine Magnetic Bead (MagPlex
®
-
C microspheres) Panel protocol (HCYTOMAG-56K, EMD Millipore Corporation, MA, USA).
The fluorescent-coded magnetic beads contain a specific capture antibody of each myokine
on the surface with internally color-coded microspheres with two fluorescent dyes detected
by Luminex
®
xMAP
®
technology. After the capture antibody incubation, a biotinylated
detection antibody is added on the assay, followed by a reaction with a Streptavidin-PE
conjugate. The high-speed digital signal processors of capture and detection components
were analyzed by a Luminex
®
analyzer (MAGPIX
®
).  The intra-assay precision (mean
coefficient variation percentage) described by the MILLIPLEX
®
Human Myokine Magnetic
Bead Panel instructions is <10%.
2.5. Dietary Intake
A prospective method of three food records was used to estimate DI during the week
before the marathon race (3rd to 8th April in 2017, and 2nd to 7th April in 2018). Dietetics
instructed the runners to fill in the meal time and all food and drinks that were ingested,
including portion size and food brand, on two days of the week and one day of the weekend.
In an interview with the runners one day before the race, the food records were checked by
a trained nutrition undergraduate student to elucidate or complete missing food data. The
energy intake (kcal), macronutrients (g or g/kg), and micronutrients (mg) were estimated by
the professional Dietbox (http:/dietbox.me) website/app. The United States Department
of Agriculture–Agricultural Research Service (USDA) food composition database and
Brazilian Table of Food Composition database (TACO, University of Campinas, São Paulo,
SP, Brazil) were used in the professional Dietbox website/app to provide the nutrient
composition of foods.
2.6. Statistical Analyses
Data of general characteristics, DI, and myokines are reported as mean±SEM of sixty
endurance runners. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad
Prism version 9).  The myokines were used as the independent variable.  The normality
of the data distribution was determined using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and the
normality was rejected. Statistical analyses of myokines were evaluated using the Kruskal–
Wallis test and Dunn’s test for multiple comparison. Correlations between myokines and
DI (macronutrients and micronutrients) were performed by the Spearman test. Statistical
significance was accepted at the level ofp< 0.05 in all analyses.  Statistical analyses of
myokine levels in runners with an adequate and inadequate intake of the percentage
of sucrose and carbohydrate in the energy intake (EI), with fiber, calcium, sodium, and
potassium intakes evaluated using the Mann–Whitney test, and carbohydrate, cholesterol,
selenium, vitamin B3, and phosphorus intakes evaluated using the Kruskal–Wallis test.
Cohen’s d was calculated to estimate the effect size of the significant differences of myokine
levels between runners with adequate and inadequate intake.

3.4. Myokines Induced by Exercise and Dietary Intake
After the race, carbohydrate intake (g/kg) was correlated with musclin and myostatin
levels (r = 0.29,p= 0.027; r = 0.32,p= 0.014), and the percentage of carbohydrate of EI was
correlated positively with musclin and FGF-21 levels (r = 0.26,p= 0.047; r = 0.33,p= 0.012).
Runners  with  adequate  carbohydrate  intake  (>5  g/kg/day)  had  higher  levels  of
myostatin 72 h after the race, with Cohen’s d = 1.46 (Figure 3C), and higher levels of
musclin after the race and 24 h after the race, with Cohen’s d = 0.90 and 0.79 (Figure 3D,E).
In the recovery period, the percentage of carbohydrate of EI was correlated positively
with IL-15 and BDNF (r = 0.34,p= 0.01; r = 0.30,p= 0.024), and sucrose intake had a positive
correlation with BDNF and FSTL levels (r = 0.36,p= 0.0049; r = 0.30,p= 0.022).
Runners with less than 45% of carbohydrate of EI had lower levels of IL-15 (Cohen’s
d = 0.59, 24 h after race) and BNDF (72 h after the race, Cohen’s d = 0.65) (Figure 3F,G), and
those with less than 10% of sucrose had lower levels of BDNF (24 h after the race, Cohen’s
d = 0.42) (Figure 3H).
Protein intake (g/kg or % of EI) was not correlated with the myokines determined in
this study in all periods (before and after the race, and in the recovery period) (data not
shown).
Cholesterol  intake  negatively  correlated  with  apelin  and  irisin  levels  (r  =−0.26,
p= 0.037; r =−0.31,p= 0.015, respectively) after the race. Runners with a higher cholesterol
intake (>600 mg/day) had lower levels of irisin (Cohen’s d = 0.71) and apelin (Cohen’s
d = 0.96) compared to runners with adequate cholesterol intake after the race (Figure 4A,B).
Cholesterol  intake  also  showed  a  negative  correlation  with  apelin  24  h  after  the  race
(r =−0.26,p= 0.44).
Fiber intake had a correlation with irisin and BDNF levels 72 h after the race (r = 0.34,
p= 0.00067; r = 0.28,p= 0.028).  Runners with a low fiber intake (<25 g/day) had lower
levels of irisin (Cohen’s d = 0.49) and BDNF (Cohen’s d = 0.60) (Figure 4C,D).

4. Discussion
Our study highlights the importance of carbohydrate, energy and vitamin C intake for
the percentage of fat mass, race time, and myokine levels before (BDNF) and after the race
(myostatin, musclin, irisin, apelin), and in the recovery period (BDNF, IL-15, FSTL, FGF-21,
myostatin, and musclin). Chronic higher sodium and cholesterol, or low fiber consumption
were demonstrated to reduce some myokine levels (BNDF, irisin, and apelin). Our results
contribute to elucidating the mechanisms involved in the effects of low or higher nutrient
intakes on tissue recovery and exercise adaptations.
In  this  study,  amateur  long-distance  runners  had  low  energy,  carbohydrate,  and
fiber intakes and higher cholesterol intakes in accordance with scientific literature, which
described low energy availability in elite and amateur athletes [12,18].  Relative Energy
Deficiency in Sport (RED-S) has been reported in male and female elite athletes and im-
pairs endocrine response (i.e., cortisol, insulin, IGF-1, adipokines, incretins), contribut-
ing to metabolic and immune dysfunction [
19–22].  Previously, we suggested that pro-
inflammatory cytokines induced by endurance exercise are higher in runners with a low
energy, carbohydrate, and fiber intake, and the adequate carbohydrate intake tended to pro-
mote higher IL-10 levels in the recovery period of intense exercise [
12]. RED (< 30 kcal·kg

), accomplished by a low carbohydrate intake, also reduces the mobilization of
fat stores, protein synthesis, metabolic rate, and glucose utilization, and the production of
growth hormones [21,22]. Herein, we have demonstrated higher percentages of fat mass
in runners with lower carbohydrate, phosphorus, and calcium intakes. There is crosstalk
between adipose tissue, and calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, which involves some
hormones such as leptin and parathormone [23].
We also observed higher percentages of runners with low energy (87.6%, <45 kcal/kg/FFM)
and carbohydrate (76.7%, <5 g/kg/day) intakes. After the race and in the recovery period,
we observed a positive correlation of myostatin and musclin with carbohydrate intake, and
higher levels of these myokines with an adequate carbohydrate intake (5 to 8 g/kg/day).
Myostatin acts in the process of protein degradation in muscle tissue via the activation of
activin receptors (type I and II) leading to the phosphorylation and activation of SMAD-
2 and SMAD-3, which forms a complex with SMAD-4, promoting the transcription of
catabolic genes,  and through the ubiquitin–proteosome system and autophagy activa-
tion [
1,3,8], myostatin inhibition seems to increase the browning of WAT by activating
the AMPK/PGC1-alpha/FNDC-5 pathway [24,25]. Activin receptors are also distributed
in other tissues, and myostatin seems to impair the growth hormone (GH)/IGF1 axis in
the liver [
26].  The positive correlation of myostatin with carbohydrate intake does not
contribute to our understanding of the role of carbohydrate intake in muscle mass repair
after endurance exercise. However, it may elucidate the role of restricted caloric and low-
carbohydrate diets, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, to
improve muscle mass and cardiometabolic health [27].
Musclin activates PPAR-gamma and promotes mitochondrial biogenesis in WAT and
skeletal muscle [28,29], and it also reduces glucose uptake in skeletal muscle through the
inhibition of Akt/PKB and PPARγand liver×receptor a (LXRα) activation [30]. Runners
with adequate carbohydrate intake had higher musclin levels, which may contribute to
improved exercise adaptations, such as the improvement of glucose homeostasis and the
browning of adipose tissue.
After or in the recovery period, the percentage of carbohydrate of EI or sucrose intake
was correlated positively with IL-15, FGF-21, BDNF, and FSTL levels, myokines that are
responsible for muscle repair, whose functions include myogenesis (BDNF, FSTL, and IL-15),
mitochondrial biogenesis (BDNF, IL-15), mytophagia (FGF-21, IL-15), autophagy (IL-15),
satellite cell activation (BDNF), anti-inflammatory response (IL-15), vascular smooth muscle
cell proliferation (IL-15), intramuscular fat oxidation, insulin sensitivity, and glucose intake
(BDNF, FGF-21, IL-15) [1–3,5,8,31–34].  Many of these myokines act in several signaling
pathways that will culminate in the activation of the transcription coactivator peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC)-1alpha and transcription factor
PPAR-gamma, which modulate genes related to the muscle autocrine/paracrine effects
cited above [25].
Moreover, these myokines promote crosstalk between skeletal muscle and other car-
diometabolic tissues, which improves glucose homeostasis (IL-15, BDNF, and FSTL), en-
hances fuel utilization of glucose and lipids (FGF-21), and enacts a cardioprotective role
(FGF-21 and BDNF) [1,5,9,33–35]. BDNF is a neurotrophin stimulated by metabolic stress
and higher intracellular calcium levels, and it acts on myocardial contraction, decreasing
the cardiomyocyte apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction, increasing motor neuron ex-
citability and cardiomyocyte contraction, and improving lipid and glucose metabolism via
p-AMPK and PGC-1αactivation [31]. Interestingly, we also observed that runners with un-
healthy behaviors, such as higher intakes of sodium or lower percentages of carbohydrate
(<45%) or fiber intake, had lower BDNF levels.
Cholesterol intake was negatively associated with apelin and irisin levels, which im-
prove carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and have cardioprotection properties[8,32,36,37].
Runners with higher cholesterol intakes (>600 mg/day) had lower levels of irisin and apelin;
moreover, runners with a lower fiber intake had lower levels of irisin. These myokines in-
clude a portion of the cell membrane protein, FNDC5, composed of 94-amino-acid residue

fibronectin III (FNIII)-2 domains, and through the intracellular signaling pathway p38
and ERK1/2, they induce the browning of WAT, the upregulation of UCP1, and the im-
provement of glucose intake on skeletal muscle and insulin sensitivity [37]. Apelin seems
to have a cardioprotective role, binding to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and
acting on the PI3K-Akt-NO signaling pathway, the reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK)
pathway, the extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2), protein kinase B/Akt, and
eNOS [38]. Lipolysis on adipose tissue, lipid oxidation, and mitochondrial biogenesis on
skeletal muscle are upregulated by apelin levels [39].
Muscle cells also require multiple protective enzyme systems involved in muscle func-
tion. In this study, we observed that after the race and in the recovery period, vitamin C was
positively correlated with IL-15, musclin, FSTL, myostatin, IL-6, and FGF-21. Vitamin C has
many physiological functions, including anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties.
However, the supplementation of vitamin C seems to be beneficial to vitamin deficiency,
but leads to controversial responses in muscle mass and function, leading to the inhibition
of protein synthesis pathways [40].
Inadequate dietary intake may influence some myokine levels responsible for the
maintenance of muscle mass and function, and for the recovery of cardiometabolic tissues
after endurance exercise, as well as enhancing adaptation to exercise.  Professionals in
the field of nutrition and sports medicine should emphasize the importance of adequate
nutrition for performance improvement, the recovery of body tissues, and for the beneficial
adaptations induced by exercise.

Abstract:The endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) is a dynamic hair-like layer expressed on the apical
surface of endothelial cells throughout the vascular system. This layer serves as an endothelial cell
gatekeeper by controlling the permeability and adhesion properties of endothelial cells, as well as by
controlling vascular resistance through the mediation of vasodilation. Pathogenic destruction of the
eGC could be linked to impaired vascular function, as well as several acute and chronic cardiovascular
conditions. Defining the precise functions and mechanisms of the eGC is perhaps the limiting factor
of the missing link in finding novel treatments for lifestyle-related diseases such as atherosclerosis,
type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome.  However, the relationship between diet,
lifestyle, and the preservation of the eGC is an unexplored territory. This article provides an overview
of the eGC’s importance for health and disease and describes perspectives of nutritional therapy for
the prevention of the eGC’s pathogenic destruction. It is concluded that vitamin D and omega-3 fatty
acid supplementation, as well as healthy dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet and the
time management of eating, might show promise for preserving eGC health and, thus, the health of
the cardiovascular system.

1. Introduction
The endothelial glycocalyx (eGC), sometimes referred to as the endothelial surface
layer, is a protective layer of glycoconjugates (e.g., carbohydrates covalently linked to
other molecules such as amino acids, proteins, lipids, etc.)  that covers the luminal side
of the endothelial cells (see Figure 1).  In homeostatic conditions, this layer serves as an
endothelial cell gatekeeper by controlling the permeability of substances from the blood to
the interstitium and initiating the adhesion of blood-carried molecules to the cell surface [1].
In addition, the eGC is crucial for proper endothelial nitric oxide production and vasodi-
latation.  Thus, the eGC serves an important regulatory function for the cardiovascular
system [2]. Pathogenic destruction of the eGC is detected in a large number of cardiovas-
cular conditions, including atherosclerosis [3,4], hypertension [5], diabetes mellitus [6],
chronic kidney disease [7], ischemia reperfusion syndrome [8], and septic shock [9]. Most
of the current research regarding the eGC is aimed towards acute care surgery and peri-
operative care, because derangement of the eGC is proposed to increase the severity of
sepsis.  Presently, little is known about the regeneration or prevention of its pathogenic
destruction in randomized controlled clinical trials [
10,11]. It is suggested that the main
reason behind this is a lack of reliable detection techniques is due to the ex vivo instability
of the eGC [12].  In addition, this important structure of the cardiovascular system has
been overseen by researchers, funding bodies, and pharmaceutical companies [13]. Nev-
ertheless, newly developed methods, such as side-stream dark-field imaging, orthogonal

polarization spectral imaging, and improved fixation techniques, have shed new light
on the eGC and its role in health and disease [
14,15].  The in-depth eGC knowledge is a
missing link in primary, secondary, and tertiary cardiovascular disease prevention and
treatment. The eGC is, therefore, a novel target for various healthcare professionals such as
nutritionists, dietitians, clinicians, surgeons, oncologists, researchers, and many others. The
relationship between diet and eGC destruction and/or restoration is still an unexplored
territory, but it might be particularly important in cardiovascular disease prevention and
treatment. The aims of the present review are the following: (1) to provide an overview of
current eGC knowledge—including factors that influence eGC structure and function in
microcirculation—in healthy conditions and in chronic vasculature-related inflammatory
pathologies; and (2) to describe perspectives of nutritional therapy, as well as diet- and
lifestyle-related behaviors for eGC destruction prevention and regeneration.

this area, leukocytes, platelets, and other blood components can reach the endothelial cell receptors
more easily and start blood clot formation, leukocyte migration, and other processes. This quicker
adhesion is important in wound healing but might contribute to chronic disease progression as well.

2. The eGC in Healthy Conditions—Extended State of eGC
The eGC is a dynamic hair-like layer expressed on the apical surface of the endothelial
cells, facing the lumen, throughout the vascular system.  It is described as a “hair-like
layer” because the structures of eGC resemble microscopic hair when observed under
the microscope [
16] (Figure 2).  Additionally, the eGC is described as a “dynamic layer”
because it undergoes continuous metabolic turnover that is dependent on the local en-
vironment; as such, in healthy, homeostatic conditions, the eGC is in a state of dynamic
equilibrium with plasma proteins and exists in an ‘extended state’. Most commonly, the
components consist of a proteoglycan backbone with many glycosaminoglycan attachment
sites.  Syndecans, glypican-1, biglycans, and perlecans are the typical proteoglycans of
the glycocalyx.  These proteoglycans mainly bind to heparan sulfate, which is the most
abundant glycosaminoglycan of the eGC (50–90% of the total glycosaminoglycan pool).
Other glycosaminoglycans that contribute to eGC integrity and permeability control are
116

Nutrients2023,15, 2573
chondroitin, dermatan, and keratan sulfates [17,18].  The final integral part of the eGC
is hyaluronan.
Hyaluronan—whichis a longer disaccharide polymer compared to chon-
droitin and heparan sulfate—is synthesized directly on the cell surface and anchored with
aCD
44
cell receptor [19]. Preventing hyaluronan loss has been suggested as particularly im-
portant in preventing the vascular complications of diabetes mellitus [
6,20]. Dognéet al. [20]
suggest that one therapeutic approach could be the inhibition of hyaluronidase 1, an en-
zyme responsible for cleaving hyaluronan from CD
44
cell receptors. However, given that
proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans are not specific to the endothelial cells, but are
ubiquitous in the human organism, the inhibition of cleavage enzymes might negatively
affect functions in other cells.  Singh et al. [21] found that immunoglobulin G (IgG)N-
glycosylation patterns in type 2 diabetes were associated with a faster decline of kidney
function, thus reflecting a pro-inflammatory state of the IgG. In that regard, studying the
glycosylation patterns of eGC components might provide a more precise way of combating
vascular symptoms.

to the thickness of the whole structure. The thickness and the net negative charge prevent the blood
components from adhering to the cell receptors.  The cell membrane (2) does not contain many
adherence receptors.  (
B) The collapsed state of the endothelial glycocalyx.  Different disruptors
can cause eGC to diminish or collapse, either directly or by triggering proteolytic enzymes that
cleave different structures, which, therefore, destroy the equilibrium with plasma proteins. Those
kinds of proteolytic enzymes are usually upregulated in inflammation. The eGC structures detach
from the cell surface and become bloodborne.   They may be measured in the blood.   The high
plasma concentration of, for example, heparan sulfate (3) or syndecan-1 (4) indicates eGC injury. In
inflammation, blood components, such as red blood cells (5) or platelets (6), have easier access to the
cell surface, and the expression of the adherence receptors on the cell membrane is upregulated (7).
eGC–endothelial glycocalyx.
To date, the main functions of the eGC layer in homeostatic conditions are protection
of the endothelial cell membrane, mechanotransduction, the regulation of vasodilatation,
and the prevention of blood clot and plaque formation (Figure 3) [22]. Another important
function of this layer is the promotion of blood flow homogeneity, which may be a useful
strategy for improving tissue perfusion in many [23]. Most eGC components, especially
the glycosaminoglycans, have anionic-ending molecules such as uronic or salicylic acid,
thereby giving the eGC a net negative charge in homeostatic conditions. The net negative
charge allows the eGC to interact with blood proteins through ionic interactions or create
repulsion against platelets and leukocytes (Figures 1 and 2A) [22,24]. A healthy eGC may
act as a sodium buffer by controlling the influx of sodium into the endothelial cells [25]. This
was proposed because positively charged sodium is most likely to be bound to negatively
charged organic material, which would provide for its osmotic inactivity.  The ‘perfect’
sodium storage place would be the eGC, given its ubiquitous position and net negative
charge in homeostatic conditions [25]. Related to this, eGC components, such as chondroitin
sulfate, may have a therapeutic application in the targeted delivery of medical substances.
This suggests an important role of eGC in the docking of oxidants, which may be the base
for developing novel enzymatic antioxidant treatments [26]

have been studied in more depth.  The functions in red and dashed boxes are currently not well
understood. Solid lines are established connections, dashed lines are potential connections. In an

Nutrients2023,15, 2573
In a healthy human body, the eGC is present in an extended state [27]. This means that
the glycocalyx components exist in equilibrium with blood proteins, thus forming a thick
and dense structure (see Figure 2A) [28].  The thickness and density of the eGC provide
significant protection for the endothelial cells by preventing the platelets and leukocytes
from adhering to the cell receptors on the cell surface. This is possible because the eGC is
much wider, and the proteoglycans extend much further into the lumen of the blood vessel
than the active sites of adherence receptors [29]. In addition, in homeostatic conditions, the
rate of synthesis of adherence receptors is lower than in acute or chronic diseases, which
further reduces the chance of blood component adherence [30] (Figure 2B).
The homeostatic eGC is often described as a vascular gatekeeper.  Indeed, the firm
and thick,  but flexible and adjustable,  structure can be imagined as a protective wall
surrounding the castle, providing great protection against intruders, with the castle being
the endothelial cell.
3. Extended eGC Activates Mechanotransduction and Endothelial Nitric Oxide Release
The  so-called  wind-in-the-trees  conceptual  model  is  sometimes  used  to  describe  one
important function of the eGC: the mechanotransduction of blood-flow-induced fluid shear
stress (Figure 4) [22]. Mechanotransduction is a process by which the eGC senses forces caused
by fluid passage through the blood vessels and translates that information inside the endothelial
cell to initiate intracellular signaling cascades. Upon receiving the signal, the endothelial cell acts
in accordance with the given information by implementing, for example, structural maintenance,
vasodilatation, senescence, or an inflammatory response [31]. This conceptual model describes
the eGC components as the trees in a forest and the blood flow as the wind. The branches are
the glycosaminoglycans, the tree trunks are the proteoglycan backbones, the cell receptors are
the grass, and the endothelial cell membrane is the ground [22].
 
Figure 4.The mechanism of mechanotransduction of a healthy, extended eGC. The syndecans (1),
hyaluronans (2), andother glycoconjugates (3) sense the changes in fluid shear force. This mechanical
signal is transduced inside the endothelial cell and causes the movement of cytoskeletal structures (4).
119

Nutrients2023,15, 2573
Those cytoskeletal structures activate the G-protein (5), which activates the transient receptor potential
(TRP) channels and causes Ca
2+
influx (6). Ca
2+
ions are needed to activate caveolin proteins on the
cell membrane (7), which attach to the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) system and activate
it. Activated eNOS generates nitric oxide (NO) (8). NO can then diffuse into the lumen of the blood
vessel or the smooth muscles and cause vasodilatation. Created with BioRender.com.
When the wind (fluid shear stress) blows through the forest, the treetops (glycosamino-
glycans) sense it and move back and forth accordingly. The sensed force is then transduced
onto the three trunks (proteoglycan core) and into the roots. The roots, in this case, would
be the cytoskeletal structures and intracellular eGC domains. When the eGC is preserved
(in the extended state), the winds’ impact (blood flow shear stress) is scattered between
the branches of the treetops, whereas the ground senses little to none of the wind’s impact.
However, the important information about the state of the blood flow is transduced via
the trees into the roots.  If the trees were not present or were sparse, the wind would
directly interact with the ground and impact the ground, while the information could not
be properly transmitted into the deeper structures.
Another theoretical review of the glycocalyx describes the mechanotransduction prop-
erties of the eGC by using a bumper car conceptual model.   This model explains the
processes inside the endothelial cell upon the arrival of signals from the blood. The bumper
car analogy came to be after an experiment which showed that dense peripheral actin
bands (DAPABs) were disrupted by uniform shear stress. In addition, the movement of
vinculin, a cytoskeletal protein, closer to the cell membrane was detected. Both observa-
tions were enhanced when higher shear stress was implemented [32]. These observations
suggest that cytoskeletal reorganization indeed occurs as a consequence of mechanical
signal transduction of the eGC. The same effect of cytoskeletal reorganization inside the
endothelial cell was not observed when the eGC was destroyed by proteolytic enzymes.
Mechanotransduction is an important mechanism used to trigger different pathways in
the endothelial cell. For example, eGC mechanotransduction initiates the process of nitric
oxide (NO) production through the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)
through  calcium/calmodulin  activation  and  consequential  Ca
2+
influx  [31]  (Figure  4).
Endothelial-derived NO exerts powerful localized vasodilatory effects on the vascular
smooth muscle cells [
33].  Additionally, NO contributes to the inhibition of platelet ag-
gregation and leukocyte adhesion. As NO is produced when eGC is preserved, the same
functions can be contributed to a healthy eGC, and a proper NO production could be an
indicator of eGC health.
4. The eGC in a State of Low-Grade Inflammation—Diminished eGC
4.1. eGC Response to Inflammation
The state of inflammation, led by the activation of the TNF-αpathway, triggers the
collapse of the eGC (described in the chapter below).  The collapse of the eGC is much
needed in acute conditions such as injury or infection, as this promotes endothelial cell
interaction with leukocytes/platelets and blood clot formation.  However, certain eGC
disruptors (described in detail later) can induce low-grade chronic inflammation, which
may lead to the development of vascular consequences of chronic diseases if disruptors
continuously trigger the shedding or endocytosis of eGC. Shedding and endocytosis are
two main responses of eGC components to various disruptions from the environment. Both
responses cause the collapse of the eGC and disrupt the dynamic equilibrium. For example,
acting on an environmental cue, a family of enzymes collectively known as sheddases
or secretases can be released and proteolytically cleave the proteoglycans’ ectodomain,
leaving it virtually intact (Figure 2B, element 4). Little is known about the exact structure
of the eGC sheddases. Novel findings by Yang et al. [34] revealed that a sheddase called
disintegrin  and  metalloproteinase  15  (ADAM15)  cleaved  the  CD
44
surface  anchor  for
hyaluronan.   These  kinds  of  shedded  ectodomains  travel  via  the  bloodstream,  where
they may function as autocrine or paracrine effectors.  The shedding mechanism both
120

Nutrients2023,15, 2573
generates soluble ectodomains and rapidly reduces the amount of cell surface heparan
sulfate [35]. Heparan sulfate reduction is much needed in conditions following acute injury,
where platelet aggregation is needed for wound healing [36]. On the other hand, different
ligands from the blood can bind to surface glycosaminoglycans and be internalized into the
endothelial cell and serve as the cell’s nutrient source. Viruses can sometimes hijack this
mechanism of ligand transport. For example, early-stage research has shown that the spike
protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts not only with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),
but with heparan sulfate as well, via the process of endocytosis or internalization [37]. These
findings suggest that eGC knowledge might be important in formulating virus treatments,
especially for the vascular consequences of the disease such as hypercoagulability and
acute coronary symptoms.
4.2. Mechanisms of eGC Collapse
TNF-αand TNF signaling are hallmarks of inflammation and have been related to the
cardiovascular pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, sepsis, diabetes, and obesity, among
others [38]. TNF-αis a master regulator of proinflammatory mediators, and the activation
of the TNF-αmetabolic pathway has a major impact on the eGC structure [38]. Studies have
demonstrated that acute exposure to TNF-αor thrombin, another inflammatory mediator,
causes rapid shedding of the glycocalyx structure [16,39]. This process results in increased
vascular permeability, tissue oedema, coronary leakage, and mast cell degranulation [40].
TNF-αactivation has a negative impact on the eGC integrity through several mechanisms,
e.g.,  by  the  induction  of  reactive  oxygen  and  nitrogen  species  (ROS/RNS)  [12]orby
activating the NF-
κB metabolic pathway [41].   Certain ROS/RNS can then cleave the
ectodomains of eGC constituents via the activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)
and inactivation of endogenous protease inhibitors [15]. Enhanced NF-κB signaling leads
to the syndecan-4 domain synthesis [42]. In these inflammatory conditions, the synthesized
syndecan-4 domains are rapidly shed from the endothelial cell surface.  This shedding
causes a disruption in the eGC integrity, but it is also proposed that, when present as a
soluble molecule in the blood, syndecan-4 may facilitate tissue fibrosis [42]. SIRT-1-deficient
endothelial cells have been shown to exhibit increased NF-κB pathways, thus shedding
syndecan-4 ectodomains [43,44].
5. eGC in Chronic Diseases
Given that eGC destruction, due to environmental factors is inherent to several chronic
pathologies, it is difficult to ascertain the contribution of eGC integrity to vascular dis-
ease progression/severity. As seen with metabolic syndrome, these kinds of diseases can
be unified when constructing prevention tactics to preserve the eGC. The pathophysi-
ology of important chronic conditions and the importance of eGC is highlighted in the
following section.
5.1. Hypertension
As mentioned previously, one of the proposed eGC functions is to buffer plasma
sodium and control its influx into the endothelial cells [25]. These findings are particularly
important when studying hypertension.  In one cross-sectional study, newly diagnosed
hypertensive patients (n= 320) had decreased eGC thickness compared to healthy controls
(n= 160).  Reduced eGC thickness was related to signs of impaired vascular function,
including increased central systolic blood pressure, as well as increased pulse wave veloc-
ity.  These findings suggest that eGC thickness is reduced in untreated hypertension [5].
However, the question of the primary disruptor of eGC destabilization in hypertension
is not yet definitively answered. Is it merely a consequence of mechanical destruction by
increased blood pressure, or is it due to high salt intake, which may cause eGC collapse
that has arterial stiffness and increased blood pressure as a consequence?  The current
evidence seems to suggest the latter. One study showed that a mere 2% increase in plasma
sodium beyond 140 mM may stiffen the endothelial cells by approximately 20% [45]. In
121

Nutrients2023,15, 2573
a related study, five days of sodium overload led to a ~50% eGC destabilization and 68%
reduction of heparan sulfate [46]. It seems that, in the state of daily sodium excess, the eGC
diminishes (Figure 2) and loses the sodium buffer capacity.
The first study to investigate the effect of salt (sodium chloride) on microvascular den-
sities using
in vivosublingual imaging was performed by Rorije et al. [47]. The researchers
aimed to determine if high salt intake would reduce sublingual microvascular density and,
therefore, reduce eGC thickness in normotensive individuals (n= 18, all-male, mean age
29±5 years). No blood pressure or sublingual microvascular differences were found when
comparing high and low salt intake groups.  However, an increase in salt consumption
significantly correlated with a lower recruitment rate of sublingual capillaries after the ad-
ministration of nitroglycerin, thus indicating lower structural microvascular density. These
findings also suggest that a high salt load by itself might be one of the first disruptors of
the eGC, which may lead to the cardiovascular damage observed in hypertensive patients.
This study opens an array of questions and discussions worth exploring further in the
attempt to prevent cardiovascular disease occurrence.
5.2. Atherosclerosis
Although research in humans is scarce, the role of the eGC in atherosclerosis in animal
models is well recognized. A healthy, extended eGC prevents the occurrence of atheroscle-
rotic plaque by ionically repelling macromolecules and mechanically preventing their
adherence to the endothelial cell, thus lowering the chance for their migration and oxida-
tion [4]. In animals, vascular sites with compromised eGC and lower mechanotransduction
function seem to be more vulnerable to inflammatory consequences and the formation of
atherosclerotic plaque [48,49].  The results from animal studies have led to an attractive
hypothesis, which suggests that clinically assessing the thickness of the eGC might allow
for the early detection of atherosclerosis. However, studies conducted in humans display
contradicting results. For example, a clear connection between eGC thickness and vascular
risk or progression/severity of vascular diseases has not been demonstrated. In one multi-
ethnic cross-sectional study (n= 6169, 42.4% male, mean age 43.6
±13), the eGC thickness
was assessed by using side-stream dark-field imagining, which is considered to be the most
suited method according to some sources [50].  Reduced eGC thickness was associated
with the female sex and diabetes after correcting for possible confounders such as age,
diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index. Reduced eGC thickness was not associated
with prevalent cardiovascular disease [51]. This study questions the viability of the used
measurement technique as a proper measure of eGC thickness and the involvement of the
eGC in atherosclerosis pathophysiology.
However,  the  cardiovascular  biomarkers  used  in  the  study  by  Valerio  et  al.  [51]
(LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) might not show a full picture of
the cardiovascular disease risk and,  therefore,  might not be reliable in comparing the
consequences of reduced eGC thickness [52]. In a certain part of the population, namely,
people with insulin resistance, the measures of LDL cholesterol can be in discordance
with apolipoprotein B (apo B) and LDL particle concentration [53]. The number of apoB-
containing lipoprotein particles is sometimes more predictive of high cardiovascular disease
risk than the cholesterol content (LDL-C). In addition, the smaller size of the lipoproteins
could be more indicative of future cardiovascular disease than the number of LDL-C packed
in these molecules, due to their greater reactivity [54].  When assessing the connection
between the eGC thickness and cardiovascular disease risk,  other cardiovascular risk
assessment parameters might be a good addition to the lipid panel.
5.3. Abdominal Obesity
The discordance in atherosclerosis risk assessment described in the chapter above
is particularly important in people with diagnosed metabolic syndrome and type 2 dia-
betes [53]. Those conditions are usually accompanied by increased visceral and ectopic fat,
which are metabolically different from subcutaneous fat and contribute to proinflammatory,
122

Nutrients2023,15, 2573
proatherogenic, and procoagulant states [55].  Visceral fat in the abdomen and ectopic
fat surrounding the liver, heart, kidneys, or pancreas accumulate as a consequence of a
chronically positive energy balance. When a person reaches their so-called “fat threshold”,
the subcutaneous fat loses its ability to expand through adipocyte hyperplasia. In that state,
the body responds by increasing visceral fat deposits, thus increasing the production of
proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-αand interleukin 6 [55]. In addition, ectopic fat
deposits can increase the hepatic production of glucose, which is a process linked to glu-
cose intolerance. The increased TNF-αactivity leads to an eGC degradation by activating
ROS/RNS and NF-κB metabolic pathway [55]. Furthermore, increased glucose production
can lead to AGE formation and further eGC destruction (see ‘The effects of elevated blood
glucose on eGC’).
5.4. Hyperglycemia, Type 2 Diabetes, and Metabolic Syndrome
Chronically increased blood glucose (i.e., hyperglycemia), a hallmark of diabetes,
metabolic syndrome, and obesity, causes the increased production of advanced glycation
end-products (AGE) [56]. AGEs are glycated proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids commonly
present in homeostatic conditions but can be rapidly generated in pathological condi-
tions, such as insulin resistance [
56].  Generated AGEs upregulate the iNOS system in
chronic uncontrolled hyperglycemia. When upregulated, the iNOS system causes eNOS
dysfunction and contributes to the inflammatory conditions of the body [57]. Both eNOS
and iNOS systems usedL-arginine and molecular oxygen to produceL-citrulline and
NO. However, when NO is produced in inflammatory conditions, it quickly reacts with
superoxide (O
2
−
) and generates peroxynitrite (ONOO
−
), which causes nitrosative stress
and damages proteins, lipids, and DNA [58].  When activated, iNOS further enhances
the generation of oxidative stress, which is a powerful process in eliminating microbial
infections and tumor cells but may also contribute to chronic disease development [59,60].
Reactions between O
2
−
and NO lower NO bioavailability, which can cause arterial stiffness
and promote atherosclerotic events [61].  AGEs form a cross-link between the basement
membrane molecules of the extracellular matrix [62], thus implying their close relationship
with the eGC; however, the interaction between AGEs and eGC, as well as the implications
for chronic disease development, are largely unknown.
AGEs activate various intercellular signals through receptor- and non-receptor-mediated
mechanisms. For example, receptors for advanced glycation end-products (RAGEs) may,
in part, explain the relationship between the eGC and AGEs. Accumulated AGEs activate
RAGE receptors that have been shown to be present on the endothelial cells and can be
shed from the surface in a manner similar to eGC components, thus forming soluble RAGEs
(sRAGEs) [63].  sRAGEs upregulate the NF-κB pathway and facilitate the inflammatory
cascade through the release of ROS/RNS. ROS/RNS contribute to the shedding of eGC
components and enhance endothelial dysfunction.  It has been shown that AGE-bound
RAGEs increase endothelial permeability to macromolecules and block NO signaling activ-
ity [64]. This is perhaps explained by the destruction of the eGC (i.e., the removal of the
endothelial gatekeeper), thus promoting the accessibility of blood component migration to
the endothelial cell.
A growing body of evidence finds that AGEs can derive from food sources and to-
bacco, and they suggest dietary AGE restriction [65,66]. In addition to AGE pro-oxidative
effects, hyperglycaemia might also be responsible for altering the sulfation patterns of
glycosaminoglycan chains and can prevent hyaluronan binding to the glycocalyx [40]. We
have shown that 14 days of sucrose supplementation (3×75 g of sucrose per day) impairs
vascular function in young healthy male subjects that was indicated by blood flow during
passive leg movement, which is a method suited for determining the impacts on mechan-
otransductionin vivo[67]. The high sucrose ingestion affected the vasodilatory properties
of the vessels, reduced eNOS activation, and upregulated PECAM-1. Given that a healthy
eGC is important for proper mechanotransduction and that PECAM-1 is upregulated in
oxidative stress that might have been caused by increased sucrose intake, these findings
123

Nutrients2023,15, 2573
suggest a disruption of the eGC. Future research is warranted to investigate the influence
of dietary sugar on the eGC, particularly regarding eGC shedding and integrity.
The effect of accumulated abdominal fat is further augmented by chronically ele-
vated glucose levels, which can cause insulin resistance, which is a hallmark of metabolic
syndrome,  diabetes,  and prediabetes [68].   In addition,  high postprandial glucose lev-
els generate AGEs, which further activate proinflammatory signaling pathways [66] (see
‘The effects of elevated blood glucose on eGC’). Pertynska-Marczewska and Merhi [69]
researched the role of the AGE–RAGE axis in the prevention of atherosclerosis in women in
menopause. They found that circulating sRAGE levels could be correlated with increased
abdominal fat, insulin resistance, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. They suggested that a
therapeutic inhibition of the RAGE signaling pathway might be beneficial for decreasing
cardiovascular disease risk in women in menopause [69]. Indeed, as discussed previously,
Valerio et al. [51] reported a correlation between diabetes and low eGC thickness, thus
implying “a small glycocalyx size in people with diabetes” (i.e., the diminished/collapsed
state of the eGC). This is in accordance with other research that showed that both acute
and chronic hyperglycaemia significantly reduced eGC size, particularly in patients with
microalbuminuria [70]. Both acute and chronic effects of hyperglycaemia on vasculature
have been recorded and are evident from the fact that the comorbidities of type 2 diabetes
are closely related to the degradation of the vascular system and eGC health [70].
5.5. Chronic Kidney Disease
One of the adverse consequences of diabetes is diabetic nephropathy, which is, next
to hypertension, a major cause of end-stage renal disease [71].  The role of the eGC in
the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy is well recognized, and efforts have been
currently made to produce specific therapies that target the regeneration of the glycocalyx
of the fenestrated glomerular endothelial cells and the prevention of albuminuria [72].
Albuminuria is a pathologic state of increased urine albumin due to improper glomerular
filtration partially caused by the destruction of the glomerular endothelial cell’s glycoca-
lyx [72]. It has been shown that people with albuminuria caused by diabetic nephropathy
have drastically increased levels of heparinase and hyaluronidase, which cause shedding of
the glycocalyx [73]. One of such efforts is the inhibition of monocyte chemotactic protein-1
(MCP-1), which is a protein that activates the migration of inflammatory cells such as
monocytes and macrophages to the kidney.  Those infiltrated glomerular macrophages
can secrete cathepsin L, which is proposed to be responsible for heparinase activation [74].
Boels et al. [75] showed that MCP- 1 inhibition significantly reduced albuminuria in diabetic
nephropathy and restored glomerular eGC dimensions.
5.6. Chronic Inflammation
Lipopolysaccharides or endotoxins are components of the outer membrane of Gram-
negative  bacteria  and  are  often  used  to  trigger  inflammation  in  experimental  studies.
In  humans,  lipopolysaccharides  usually  originate  from  the  skin,  local  infections,  and
mucosal membranes.  In some instances, lipopolysaccharides may cause endotoxemia,
which is marked by the activation of TNF-
αand iNOS inflammatory pathways and a
consequential increase in oxidative stress and inflammation [76]. Inagawa et al. [77] noticed
that  the  eGC  of  the  lungs  was  severely  diminished  under  experimental  endotoxemia
conditions.  These findings suggest a causal relationship between the disruption of the
eGC and microvascular endothelial dysfunction, which is a characteristic of sepsis-induced
acute respiratory distress syndrome.  In one pioneer research, Li et al. [78] showed that
100 ng of maresin conjugates in tissue regeneration 1 (MCTR1) increased the survival
rates of mice from lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis.  These researchers also found a
reduction in serum heparan sulfate and syndecan-1 levels in mice treated with MCTR1
compared to the control group, which indicates lower rates of eGC shedding. MCTR1 is
produced in macrophages by the 14-lipoxygenation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) [79].
This fact may show importance in researching the connection between the eGC and the
124

Nutrients2023,15, 2573
dietary intake of DHA (discussed later). eGC destruction might be connected to chronic
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. IBDs
are marked by chronic low-grade inflammation, which is believed to originate from the gut
endotoxins [80]. People with IBD have higher rates of intestinal permeability and serum
levels of lipopolysaccharides, which may negatively influence the eGC by activating the
TNF-αinflammatory pathway, which destroys the eGC integrity [81].
Sodium glucose co transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are administered in the treatment
of both type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, and the positive effect of SLGT2 in-
hibitors on vascular function may be related to eGC recovery. Decreased oxidative stress
seem to be one of the mediators of the effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors, and since ROS are
known disruptors of the endothelial glycocalyx, SGLT2 inhibitors may improve mechan-
otransduction, restore nitric oxide production, and improve vasodilation. Future research
should aim to confirm this hypothesis.
6. Perspectives of Nutritional Therapy for eGC Health
The presented evidence suggests a close connection between the pathophysiology of
various chronic diseases and points towards eGC destruction as a driver of endothelial
dysfunction and consequent vascular injury. Any chronic damage to the eGC can result
in vascular permeability, oedema, platelet aggregation, and aprothrombotic environment,
which are consequences that are well recognized in the end stages of chronic conditions
such as diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and obesity [40]. Defining the eGC
disruptors and regenerative compounds might be the future of eGC prevention or recovery
therapy in both healthy and diseased individuals. A few potential nutritional and behavior-
related therapies are discussed in the chapter below.
6.1. Preventing Vitamin D Deficiency
The first described functions of vitamin D were related to immunity, viral disease, and
autoimmune disease prevention [82].  This ancient function is being rediscovered, with
findings suggesting an association between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 symptoms,
particularly thrombosis and coagulopathy, which are the same symptoms related to heparan
sulfate loss [
83,84]. Given that heparan sulfate is one of the SARS-CoV-2 receptors, a logical
postulate would be that improper heparan sulfate synthesis in COVID-19 is responsible
for some of the observed symptoms. In recent times, vitamin D has also been connected to
the preservation of the endothelial function through monocyte adhesion prevention and
inflammation reduction [85]. This suggests that vitamin D could be an essential element for
preserving or regenerating the eGC. Future research studies are warranted to investigate
the role of vitamin D on eGC health and patient groups that will administer vitamin D as
therapy for, e.g., hyperparathyroidism or osteoporosis, which might provide the first line
of evidence.
6.2. Vitamin D and eGC Connection Hypothesis
For vitamin D to be activated, it needs to be converted into the hormonal 1,25-OH
vitamin D. The enzymes needed for that conversion are the vitamin D receptor (VDR)
and 1-a-hydroxylase, both of which can be found in cardiovascular tissues. Particularly,
the VDR is expressed on the endothelial cells and is upregulated under stress [86]. When
activated, the VDR affects calcium influx across the endothelial cell membrane, which
is needed for eNOS activation and proper nitric oxide release. As mechanotransduction
signals arising from the eGC activate this process, a close interaction between vitamin D
and eGC has been suggested [87].
Vitamin D has a role in immunity; particularly, it has been shown that vitamin D
regulates apoptosis and autophagy. One of its protective mechanisms is thought to be the
inhibition of superoxide anion generation, NF-κB, and TNF-α[88].  In one randomized
controlled trial, Omidian et al. [
89] found a significant reduction in TNF-αlevels when
supplementing diabetic patients with 4000 IU/day of vitamin D for three months.  This
125

Nutrients2023,15, 2573
evidence is another argument in favor of the protective role of vitamin D on eGC, as TNF-α
degrades the glycocalyx.
6.3. Supplementing with Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Probiotics
Combined supplementation with probiotics and omega-3 (Ω-3) fatty acids might be
important in eGC regeneration. Probiotic strains such as Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria
lower lipopolysaccharide-dependent chronic low-grade inflammation by inhibiting the
binding of lipopolysaccharide to the CD
14
receptor, thereby reducing the overall activation
of NF-κβ.Ω-3 fatty acids have been shown to increase Bifidobacteria—via unclarified
mechanisms—which then suppress lipopolysaccharide and decrease lipopolysaccharide-
producing bacteria, such as Enterobacteria [90]. Supplementation withΩ-3 has repeatedly
been shown to decrease endothelial dysfunction and increase vasodilation and vessel
elasticity, as well as decrease inflammatory pathways [91–93].
Taken together with the proposed vitamin D connection,  the presented evidence
suggests that interactions between lipid metabolism and eGC might be particularly relevant
to research further. When conducting such studies, the type of dietary fat is an important
factor to consider. Some studies suggest that fat-rich and energy-rich diets are the main
source of increased endotoxemia, whereas unsaturated fatty acids have been associated with
lower postprandial circulating levels of lipopolysaccharides [90,94,95]. Caution must be
taken with the potential cofounders. Dietary sugars and salt might also be eGC disruptors,
so their influence should be considered when forming further hypotheses and experiments.
6.4. Providing the eGC Building Blocks
Currently, there are two nutraceuticals on the market that have been developed with
the purpose of eGC regeneration. Various other therapies such as metformin, rosuvastatin,
hydrocortisone, sulodexide, and heparin have been proposed as having eGC regenerative
properties [96].  The main premises of the developing therapies are to provide the eGC
with the building blocks for quicker regeneration or to remove eGC disruptors. An impor-
tant animal study showed that a 10-week treatment that targeted the eGC by using high
molecular weight hyaluronan and other eGC components improved eGC properties and
ameliorated age-related arterial dysfunction in old mice. The findings suggest that the eGC
may be a potential therapeutic target for treating age-related arterial dysfunction [97].
Healthy  dietary  patterns,  particularly  the  Mediterranean  diet  (MedDiet),  Nordic
diet, Traditional Asian diet, and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), have
been shown to be beneficial in reducing the risk of arterial dysfunction and other diet-
related chronic diseases [98–100]. Compared to a typical Western-style diet, these kinds of
dietary patterns are characterized by lower trans fat and lower excess sodium and sugar
consumption (lower meat and processed food intake), higher fiber intake (from whole
grains and legumes), higher fruit and vegetables content, and higherΩ-3 content (from fish
and nuts) [101]. Studies suggest that the MedDiet is suitable as a type 2 diabetes therapy,
as it was associated with improved glycemic control when compared to a control dietary
pattern [102]. In addition, some long-term randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses
showed a greater chance of remission from metabolic syndrome following the MedDiet
and a significant reduction in stroke incidence [
102,103].  One possible explanation for
the observed health benefits could be that healthy dietary patterns contain the building
blocks for preventing the pathological destruction and/or regenerating the eGC, thus
decreasing cardiovascular disease risk. Further large-scale studies are needed to confirm
the connection to healthy dietary patterns, which might also be useful as a source of the
eGC building blocks and, therefore, may decrease cardiovascular disease risk.  Further
large-scale studies are needed to confirm the connection [104]. Other potential beneficial
dietary components are discussed in the chapters that follow.
126

Nutrients2023,15, 2573
6.5. Dietary Sulfur
Sulfur-containing compounds might help reduce eGC damage by exhibiting antiox-
idative and anti-inflammatory properties and are, therefore, good candidates to be imple-
mented in preventative nutritional therapy [105]. High levels of sulfur can be found in meat
and fish, as sulfur is a part of the sulfur-containing amino acids (methionine and cysteine).
However, Doleman et al. [106] state that an impressive 89.5% of dietary sulfur in a typical
diet derives from other sources due to the differences in the distribution of types of food.
Intake from alliaceous and cruciferous vegetables contributed to almost half of the total
sulfur intake. Both alliaceous vegetables (for example onion, garlic, or leek) and cruciferous
vegetables (such as broccoli, kale, asparagus, or mangold) are abundant in various healthy
dietary patterns. In alliaceous vegetables, sulfur is a part of organosulfur compounds and is
known for its effectiveness in eliminating viral and bacterial infections [107]. Interestingly,
one double-blinded placebo-controlled randomized study found that aged garlic extract
may protect and slightly improve the microcirculation in patients with a Framingham Risk
Score≥10 (increased risk for cardiovascular disease) [108]. To date, this is the largest study
researching the effects of garlic extract on microcirculation.
Sulfur is also a structural part of isothiocyanates, which are, in a broad range, found
in cruciferous vegetables, which are staples of healthy dietary patterns [105]. Sulforaphane,
the most researched isothiocyanate, exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties
that have been confirmed in variousin vivoand epidemiological studies and may reduce
levels of fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin [109], as well as AGE concentra-
tion [110].  When researching the effects of sulforaphane in mice models of skin cancer,
Alyoussef and Taha [111] found that sulforaphane blocked sulfatase-2 activity which, when
activated, significantly elevated heparan sulfate proteoglycan concentration in plasma. The
main function of sulforaphane is thought to be the activation of the antioxidative nuclear
factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) metabolically pathway, which ameliorates excess oxidative
stress upon activating numerous cytoprotective proteins [111].  One of those proteins is
metallothionein, a cysteine protein that binds copper and zinc as cofactors. When activated,
metallothionein can extinguish ROS/RNS due to its high thiol content [112].  In animal
models of type 1 diabetes, sulforaphane and zinc have proven to be more cardioprotective
when combined [112]. Human studies are needed to further substantiate this evidence. The
eGC is a ubiquitous structure with a relatively high amount of sulfur-containing compo-
nents such as heparan and chondroitin sulfates, which are in an almost constant state of
metabolic turnover [17]. Aside from its antioxidative properties, dietary sulfur might be an
important sulfur donor and could provide the building blocks for eGC regeneration.
6.6. Dietary Nitrates
Dietary nitrates are high in green leafy vegetables and some root vegetables, such
as beetroot. In research, dietary nitrates are usually provided as beetroot juice or sodium
nitrate and have been shown to reduce inflammation and thrombosis; however, the findings
are not conclusive [113]. The explanation behind the beetroot juice intervention is based on
the hypothesis that providing an exogenous source of nitric oxide might improve endothe-
lial function. Most of the acute and short-term research on hypertensive patients in this
area shows substantial improvements in resting blood pressure and muscle microvascular
function, as well as reduced arterial stiffness [114,115]. On the contrary, longer (7 days) but
similarly designed studies did not find improvements in cardiac function or endothelial
integrity in healthy non-smoking adults [116]. Furthermore, two-week supplementation of
beetroot juice was insufficient to improve blood pressure or endothelial function in type 2
diabetics [117].
One of the possible explanations for the discordance in evidence might be the fact
that a healthy and extended eGC is responsible for proper nitric oxide production [
31].
Providing the end product (nitric oxide) will not regenerate the eGC but can be beneficial
in providing nitric oxide in, for example, people who are newly diagnosed with a chronic
vascular disease, based on the observation that eGC is destroyed in these conditions. In
127

Nutrients2023,15, 2573
that case, beetroot juice provides a secondary source of nitric oxide and acutely helps in the
preservation of vascular function until the eGC is fully restored and regains the ability to
produce endogenous nitric oxide. This hypothesis would explain the acute beneficial effect
and long-term stagnation of the results seen in some studies and in healthy subjects.
6.7. Lifestyle Changes
Dietary and lifestyle modifications that promote weight loss in overweight and obese
individuals have been shown to be beneficial in decreasing vascular fat storage and in-
flammatory molecule production [118]. In recent years, professional-led weight loss even
helped in completely reversing type 2 diabetes by impacting secondary insulin resistance
to reduced hyperinsulinemia [119]. In that sense, weight loss could be a powerful tool in
preventing eGC damage, as it combats many eGC disruptors simultaneously. Collectively,
weight loss can eliminate inflammatory cytokines generated by visceral fat, decrease blood
glucose levels, and prevent the formation of AGEs [54]. The combination of a healthy di-
etary pattern, caloric restriction, and physical activity has been used in clinical settings and
shows promising results for treating non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases, which are frequently
present in patients diagnosed with diabetes, insulin resistance, and obesity [120].
Intermittent fasting, prolonged fasting, time-restricted eating, and similar dietary
strategies are based on restricting daily time defined for eating and prolonging fasting
time [
121].  The beneficial effect of intermittent fasting on vascular health parameters,
microcirculation, and vasodilatation has been detected, even in the absence of weight loss
in both healthy individuals and men with prediabetes [122,123]. The observed effects were
related to lower blood pressure, increased insulin sensitivity, decreased oxidative stress,
and higher levels of nitric oxide release. However, the mechanisms of the positive effects
are not yet fully discovered [124].
The  eGC  might  hold  the  key  in  explaining  the  observed  positive  effects  of  time-
restricted dietary regimes; however, repeated uniform intermittent fasting studies with a
reliable measure for eGC thickness are needed to confirm this hypothesis.  If confirmed,
intermittent fasting (or other interventions based on time restriction of eating) might be
useful in nutritional therapy for vascular consequences of chronic diseases. Recent findings
in this area suggest that setting the eating window earlier in the day may be optimal due to
the natural circadian rhythms of humans which control hormone release, thus influencing
stress levels and insulin resistance [125,126].
7. Conclusions
Deep and precise knowledge regarding the eGC seems to be the missing link in finding
novel treatments for lifestyle-related diseases such as atherosclerosis,  type 2 diabetes,
hypertension, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Changes in the eGC integrity might be
an early sign of cardiovascular disease development.   The detection of these changes
could particularly be important for raising adherence to healthy dietary patterns and
lifestyle  interventions  that  have  proven  to  be  cardio-protective.   Studying  vitamin  D,
omega-3 fatty acids, probiotics, dietary sulfurs, and dietary nitrates could be promising
in exploring the connection between diet components and eGC regeneration.  Lifestyle
interventions such as weight loss and time management of eating might be important for
eGC regeneration. Increasing research in this area could provide more precise guidelines in
chronic cardiovascular disease prevention.

Abstract:Skeletal muscle is the largest tissue in the human body, comprising approximately 40% of
body mass. After damage or injury, a healthy skeletal muscle is often fully regenerated; however,
with aging and chronic diseases, the regeneration process is usually incomplete, resulting in the
formation of fibrotic tissue, infiltration of intermuscular adipose tissue, and loss of muscle mass
and strength, leading to a reduction in functional performance and quality of life.  Accumulating
evidence has shown that omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and their lipid mediators
(i.e., oxylipinsand endocannabinoids) have the potential to enhance muscle regeneration by positively
modulating the local and systemic inflammatory response to muscle injury. This review explores the
process of muscle regeneration and how it is affected by acute and chronic inflammatory conditions,
focusing on the potential role of n-3 PUFAs and their derivatives as positive modulators of skeletal
muscle healing and regeneration.

1. Introduction
Skeletal muscle is the largest tissue in the human body, comprising approximately
40%  of  body  mass,  and  has  an  essential  role  in  energy  metabolism,  locomotion,  and
stability [1]. These actions can be compromised by muscle damage or injury resulting from
a variety of events, including lacerations, contusions, strains, or exercise [2].  Following
damage, a healthy skeletal muscle is often fully regenerated; however, with aging and
chronic diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, and muscular dystrophies, the regeneration process may be incomplete,
resulting in the formation of fibrotic tissue, infiltration of intermuscular ectopic adipose
tissue, and loss of muscle mass and strength [
3–6], which might lead to a reduction in
functional performance and quality of life.
Satellite  cells  (SCs)  are  considered  the  major  players  in  the  regeneration  process
after muscle injury [
7].  They are located between the sarcolemma and the basal lamina,
representing approximately 2–7% of skeletal muscle cells [3,8,9]. In homeostatic conditions,
these cells reside in their niche in a quiescent state, whereas upon muscle damage, SCs
become activated and proliferate to form myogenic precursor cells (i.e., myoblasts). An
efficient regenerative capacity is supported by the maintenance of a promyogenic muscle
niche  by  additional  cells  in  the  local  milieu,  including  mesenchymal  fibroadipogenic
progenitors (FAPs), immune cells (i.e., eosinophils, macrophages, Treg), and endothelial
cells [10,11]. In the presence of a favorable promyogenic cellular microenvironment, most

Nutrients2023,15, 871
of the SCs differentiate and form new myocytes that fuse with damaged myofibers, leading
to muscle tissue repair, while a fraction of the SC population, generated by asymmetric
division, self-renew and return to quiescence.  In parallel, a tightly regulated and time-
dependent recruitment of immune cells occurs, releasing inflammatory factors (e.g., TNF-
α, IL-6), which also have the capacity to promote SC activation and proliferation. Later in
the regeneration process, immune cells together with FAP cells contribute to the removal
of  cell  debris  and  necrotic  tissue  [12–14].   This  response  is  followed  by  the  clearance
of proinflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of anti-inflammatory immune cells,
promoting SC differentiation, tissue repair, and the return of tissue homeostasis [15–17].
In chronic inflammatory conditions, this process is usually dysregulated and impaired,
preventing the healing of damaged tissue, leading to loss of muscle function and decreased
quality of life [18,19].   In consequence,  it is of major importance to develop strategies
that can mitigate and adequately regulate the inflammatory response after muscle injury.
Accumulating evidence has shown that the omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFAs) and their lipid mediators (i.e., oxylipins and endocannabinoids) have the potential
to enhance muscle regeneration by positively modulating the local and systemic inflam-
matory response to muscle injury [20–22]. This review will explore the process of muscle
regeneration and how it is affected by acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, focusing
on the potential role of n-3 PUFAs and their derivatives as positive modulators of skeletal
muscle healing and regeneration.
2. An Inflammatory Process Initiates Skeletal Muscle Repair
The inflammatory response triggered by an acute muscle injury is required to com-
mand SCs proliferation and myogenesis, and coordinates scavenger activity and phagocy-
tosis to properly eradicate cellular debris and progress to tissue regeneration (Figure 1). The
initiation, development, and resolution of the inflammatory response involves interactions
between circulating and resident immune cells and SCs within the muscle tissue [11], of
which the most abundant are mast cells and macrophages [
13].  These resident cells act
as the primary responders to injury by secreting proinflammatory molecules, including
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) [23].
This initial burst promotes vasodilation, vascular permeability, and rapid recruitment of
neutrophils, which ingest and remove cellular debris from the damaged tissue and release
a myriad of chemokines and cytokines that attract the recruitment of monocytes [24], and
activation of FAPs via the interleukin 4 signaling pathway [14]. The infiltrated monocytes
divide into two main categories: (1) Ly6C+ monocytes, which peak during the first few
days of injury (days 1–3); and (2) the Ly6C
−monocytes, which are recruited later (days
3–7) for the optimum regeneration of muscle tissue.  The Ly6C+ and Ly6C
−monocytes
rapidly differentiate into the proinflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages,
respectively. The M1 macrophage phenotype expresses proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β,
IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α), responsible for the activation and proliferation of SCs, while the
M2 macrophage phenotype is responsible for the release of anti-inflammatory molecules
such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), promoting the differentiation
and fusion of myotubes into damaged myofibers, leading to proper regeneration [11]. On
the other hand, the activated resident FAPs will proliferate within a narrow time window,
generally no longer than 5 days postinjury, and secrete a plethora of promyogenic cytokines
and growth factors, including Follistatin, IL-6, WNT1 inducible signaling pathway protein 1
(WISP1), and IGF-1 [
25]. Later, FAP numbers rapidly return to basal levels by the induction
of apoptosis, a mechanism mediated by the release of TNF-αby M1 macrophages [26].

The inflammatory response to damage also leads to the production of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) (collectively known as RONS), from
circulating and resident immune cells. The RONS are molecules with one or more unpaired
electrons in atomic or molecular orbitals derived from oxygen or nitrogen [27]. The main
RONS formed in cells include superoxide (O2-), and nitric oxide (NO). Both O2- and NO
can rapidly combine to produce peroxynitrite, and its reaction is three times faster than the
dismutation of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide via superoxide dismutase (SOD) [28]. In
healthy muscle, RONS activate signaling pathways essential for proper muscle regenera-
tion [27]; however, when RONS are exacerbated (i.e., chronic inflammatory conditions), it
can lead to impaired regeneration through the inhibition of myogenesis, cell death, and
loss of muscle function [
29]. Collectively, these processes highlight the importance of an
efficient and coordinated inflammatory response after muscle injury, as slight shifts in the
inflammatory and oxidative stress responses could decrease muscle regenerative capacity
as observed in obese and aged populations.
A crucial yet overlooked metabolic process regulating the inflammatory response
after muscle damage is the synthesis of bioactive lipid metabolites derived from n-3 and
n-6 PUFAs, the oxylipins and endocannabinoids.  These lipid mediators are suggested
to regulate the muscle regeneration process via autocrine and paracrine inflammatory
signaling of immune cells.
3. Role of PUFAs on Inflammation Resolution
Fatty acids (FAs) have diverse functions of physiological importance as they are major
components of cellular membranes, precursors for the synthesis of bioactive lipids, and
137

Nutrients2023,15, 871
major sources of energy [30]. Saturated FAs contain no double bonds in their hydrocarbon
chain, have a rigid structure, and are the most abundant FAs in the human diet, with
palmitic and stearic acid as the most popular.  Conversely, unsaturated FAs have one or
more double bonds in their hydrocarbon chain; those with one double bond are classified
as monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). The most common MUFAs are omega-7 (n-7)
and omega-9 (n-9), with palmitoleic acid and oleic acid being the most consumed in the
diet, respectively. Both MUFAs have been reported to reduce the risk of heart disease and
inflammation [31,32].
FAs with two or more double bonds are classified as polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFAs). PUFAs are mainly composed by n-3 and n-6 fatty acids. N-3 PUFAs have their
first double bond on the third hydrocarbon chain when counted from the methyl terminus,
whereas  the  n-6  PUFAs  have  their  first  double  bond  on  the  sixth  hydrocarbon  chain.
The shortest members of each family are
α-linolenic acid (C18:3n-3, ALA) and linoleic
acid (C18:2n-6, LA), which are 18 hydrocarbons in acyl-chain length [
33–35].  Through
a series of reactions catalyzed by the same enzymes in the liver,  ALA and LA can be
further metabolized by desaturation and elongation to eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5n-3,
EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3, DHA), and to arachidonic acid (C20:4n-6, AA),
respectively [35,36]. As n-6 PUFAs are consumed in the diet 15 times more than n-3 PUFAs,
this process results in a higher synthesis of AA at the expense of EPA and DHA [30]. In
consequence, the presence of n-3 PUFAs in cell membranes and tissues is typically low and
depends on the amount of EPA and DHA ingested in the diet. Thus, when consumed in
high quantities, EPA and DHA are incorporated into cell membrane phospholipids [37],
resulting in a decreased synthesis of n-6 PUFAs derivatives and an increased synthesis of
n-3 PUFA-lipid mediators [38].  As the n-6 PUFAs are associated with proinflammatory
actions [39] and the n-3 lipid derivatives are known for their anti-inflammatory and pro-
resolving actions [40–42],  their concentrations in cell membranes could determine the
regeneration process after muscle injury.
There is emerging evidence that bioactive lipids derived from n-3 and n-6 PUFAs
play a key role in the initiation and resolution of the inflammatory response [12,43]. After
a muscle injury, n-3 and n-6 PUFAs are rapidly released from immune cell membrane
phospholipids via phospholipase enzymes and metabolized via enzymatic reactions to the
lipid mediators oxylipins and endocannabinoids [44]. During the early stages of injury, the
classical n-6 PUFA-derived lipid mediators are synthesized and released, promoting acute
inflammation by regulating local blood flow, vascular permeability, cytokine production,
and leukocyte chemotaxis [12]. Later, a shift in the profile of these mediators results in the
generation of oxylipins and endocannabinoids mainly derived from n-3 PUFAs, whose
functions are to actively resolve and terminate inflammation, leading to tissue regeneration
and return to homeostasis [45,46].
The pathways involved in the formation of oxylipins and endocannabinoids are a
complex network of time-specific enzymatic reactions, and to date have not been fully
elucidated (Figure 2). These metabolites act as intercellular messengers and mediators of
the muscle regeneration process by regulating the inflammatory response to injury [12].
The oxylipins represent the most common and widest family of bioactive lipids synthesized
from the long-chain n-6 and n-3 precursors, including LA, AA, ALA, EPA, and DHA [45].
These PUFAs are released upon endogenous and exogenous stimuli from membrane phos-
pholipids via phospholipase A2, although they can be released by phospholipase C, and
metabolized into their bioactive products via cyclooxygenase (COX), lipooxygenase (LOX),
and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes [15]. Once formed, oxylipins can mediate their
biological effects via interactions with G protein-coupled receptors or intracellular effectors,
including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ)[15]. The oxylipins
derived from AA (n-6) are the most common and include the two-series prostaglandins
(PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), and the four-series leukotrienes (LTs); meanwhile, EPA (n-3)
is the precursor of the three-series PGs and TXs and five-series LTs.  The PGs, TXs, and
LTs are all proinflammatory in nature; however, those that are EPA-derived are less potent
138

Nutrients2023,15, 871
compared with those synthesized from AA [44].  Oxylipins with anti-inflammatory and
proresolving activities are mostly derived from EPA and DHA, including the resolvins (Rv)
from EPA (E series) and DHA (D series) and the DHA-derived maresins (Ma) and pro-
tectins (Pr), collectively termed “specialized pro-resolving mediators” (SPMs). AA-derived
lipoxins also contribute to this group [43].
 
Figure 2.Omega-6 (n-6) and omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) lipid mediators. The
n-6 PUFA, linoleic acid (LA), is elongated and desaturated in the liver to arachidonic acid (AA). AA
is processed by immune cells and converted into the two-series prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes
(Txs), the four-series leukotrienes (LTs), and to the endocannabinoids, 2-acylglycerols (2-AG) and
n-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA). This metabolic pathway is associated with proinflammatory
actions. On the other hand, the n-3 PUFA,α-linoleic acid (ALA), is elongated and desaturated in the
liver to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Immune cells convert EPA to
the three-series PG, TXs, five-series LTs, to the endocannabinoids, eicosapentanoylglycerol (EPG),
eicosapentaenoylethanolamide (EPEA), and to the e-series derived resolvins (Rv). DHA is converted
to docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (DHEA) and docosaheanoyl-glycerol (DHG) and to the D-series
Rv, maresins (Ma) and protectins (Pr). The n-3-derived lipid mediators have anti-inflammatory and
proresolving actions, which may accelerate the muscle regeneration process.
The family of endocannabinoids consists of the precursors 2-acylglycerols and ethano-
lamides, of which the most abundant and best characterized are the n-6-derived 2-arachid-
onoylglycerol(2-AG) and n-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA, anandamide), respectively [47].
The 2-AG are agonists with low-to-moderate affinity for cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2
(CB1-2), while AEA is a partial agonist with a higher affinity to bind to CB1 relative to
CB2. Both CB1 and CB2 are expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral
tissues [48]. CB1 are predominantly expressed in the CNS and are responsible for mediating
neurobehavioral activities such as the regulation of appetite and executive functions [49].
Meanwhile,  CB2  are  mainly  expressed  in  peripheral  tissues,  including  cells  from  the
139

Nutrients2023,15, 871
immune system, and therefore are in part responsible for mediating the inflammatory
response to injury or pathogens [
50].  Notably, exogenous anandamide during lactation
increases body fat content and CB1 receptor levels in adipose tissue [51].
Recent evidence has shown that the n-3 PUFAs can also be converted into 2-acylglycerols
and ethanolamides, including eicosapentanoylglycerol (EPG), eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamide
(EPEA), docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (DHEA), and docosahexanoyl-glycerol (DHG) [
52].
Moreover,  they can be further metabolized by COX, LOX, and CYP450 enzymes into
bioactive endocannabinoid epoxides [53,54], agonists with greater affinity for CB receptors
than their former metabolites [46].  As the endocannabinoids derived from n-3 and n-6
PUFAs have been shown to have anti-inflammatory activity, they could play an important
role in the muscle regeneration process; however, evidence to date is scarce.
Overall, oxylipins and endocannabinoids are synthesized from membrane-bound n-3
and n-6 PUFAs of immune cells and peripheral tissues. These metabolites share some ac-
tions, including the immune cells’ inflammatory response to stress or injury, and thus play
an important role in the muscle regeneration process [20,21,46]. Indeed,in vitroand rodent
studies have recently shown that n-3 PUFAs and their derived metabolites positively mod-
ulate the inflammatory response to muscle injury [21,55–59]. Furthermore, daily ingestion
of >1 g/d EPA and DHA increases n-3-derived oxylipin [38] and endocannabinoid [60,61]
levels in humans. Interestingly, when administered in periods longer than eight weeks, EPA
and DHA can increase muscle protein synthesis [62] and significantly reduce symptoms
after eccentric exercise-induced damage [63], which may indicate an enhanced muscle
regeneration.  In turn, it has been described that oxylipin levels depend on the skeletal
muscle type; for example, in the soleus, a muscle with predominant composition (~80%) of
slow-twitch fibers [64], there is more oxylipin content than in the gastrocnemius muscle,
which contains a mixed-fiber composition [65]. The latter suggests that the accumulation of
oxylipins could be regulated according to muscle fiber type. This fact could be relevant in
the phenotypic muscle fiber shift observed during ageing, that features a distinctive fast-to-
slow fiber type transition and subsequent muscle weakness [66]. On this basis, we speculate
that the improvements in muscle regeneration observed after n-3 PUFA supplementation
could be in part mediated by increased production of n-3 PUFA-derived oxylipins and
endocannabinoids, which may reflect a redistribution of muscle fiber composition.
4. Potential Beneficial Effects of n3-PUFA-Derived Metabolites in Muscle
Regeneration: Evidence from In Vitro Muscular Cell Lines, Adult Skeletal Fibers, and
Animal Models
Following myofiber damage, a rise in the production of proinflammatory n-3 and n-6
PUFA-derived oxylipins and endocannabinoids is necessary for the proper regulation of
muscle regeneration [21].  However, in chronic proinflammatory conditions, commonly
observed with aging and metabolic diseases, the muscle regeneration process is impaired
and linked to fibrosis and infiltration of lipids [19]. Moreover, in aging, there is a deficiency
of intramuscular pro-resolving lipid mediator biosynthesis, and RvD1 treatment does not
rescue age-related defects in myofiber regeneration [67]. These alterations may be associated
with an overproduction of n-6 PUFA-derived metabolites and a decreased synthesis of the
bioactive pro-resolving anti-inflammatory lipids oxylipins and endocannabinoids derived
from the n-3 PUFAs.  In this context, a rise in the concentrations of n-3 PUFA-derived
metabolites, through administration of EPA, DHA, and/or n-3 PUFA-derived metabolites,
could be a potential strategy to enhance muscle regeneration [20,21,46].
The incorporation of n3-PUFA into cell membranes affects the skeletal muscle pro-
liferation and differentiation processes via changes in membrane fluidity, membrane mi-
crodomains involved in cellular signaling, and via the regulation of inflammation through
the production of n-3 PUFA-derived metabolites [37,68]. Interestingly, to date, there is little
evidence regarding the beneficial role of n3-PUFAs and their derivatives in the myogenic
process, mostly because experiments have been performed in uninjured or inflammation-
free conditions [69]. In these conditions, both EPA and DHA downregulate the proliferation
and differentiation of C2C12 skeletal muscle cells when compared to a fatty-acid free con-
140

Nutrients2023,15, 871
trol condition [55,56,70–72].  These effects appear to be dose- and time- dependent with
higher doses (>50μM) and longer incubation times (>48 h), yielding increased inhibition
of SC proliferation and differentiation, which has been suggested to be mediated by the
accumulation of lipid droplets [70]. To the best of our knowledge, only one study has exam-
ined the role of the n-3 PUFA-derived metabolites on myogenesis [21]. Murine C2C12 cells
incubated with a supraphysiological dose of RvD1 (1μM) resulted in increased myotube
diameter [21]. Similarly, mature C2C12 myotubes incubated with very high concentrations
of EPA (400–600μM) and DHA (300–700μM) decreased protein degradation through
partial inhibition of the proinflammatory NF-κB pathway [73]. Thus, it appears that very
high doses of n-3 PUFAs and/or their derived metabolites promote myofiber hypertrophy
by decreasing inflammation and protein degradation.
In vitro
treatment with proinflammatory molecules (e.g., palmitate, TNF-α, lipopolysa-
ccharide [LPS]) mimics some of the metabolic abnormalities associated with chronic inflam-
mation, including decreased protein synthesis, increased protein degradation, and muscle
atrophy [57,74–76]. Under these conditions, the effects of n-3 PUFA and their derivatives on
myogenesis are promising. First, DHA treatment protects against muscle palmitate-induced
myofiber atrophy [76–78].  Similarly, the addition of 25μM of EPA or DHA suppresses
the decline in myotube diameter and myofibrillar protein content induced by LPS [
79],
and cotreatment with 700
μM PA and 50μM of EPA or DHA blunts the expression of
IL-6 and TNF-
αinduced by PA alone in C2C12 myotubes [80].  Secondly, exposure to
EPA-derived oxylipin RvE1 decreased LPS-induced IL-6 and MCP-1 expression in C2C12
myotubes [58]. Moreover, RvE1 attenuated secreted IL-6 protein levels and prevented LPS-
induced myotube atrophy. Likewise, the DHA-derived oxylipin RvD1 protected against
TNF-α-mediated myotube atrophy [21]. Mechanistically, these effects appear to be medi-
ated in part by the restoration of the Akt/mTOR/FoxO3 pathway involved in the muscle
differentiation process [76,77], as well as the inhibition of the proinflammatory transcription
factors activation protein-1 and NF-κB[80–82]. Moreover, in dystrophic myoblasts derived
from dystrophin-deficient mdx mice exposed to proinflammatory macrophage-conditioned
medium, treatment with RvD2 enhanced myoblast differentiation compared to control
and prednisone-treated groups [
83].  This effect was associated with a 2-fold increase in
myogenin-expressing differentiated myoblasts along with a concomitant decrease in the
proportion of undifferentiated Pax7+ cells. In addition, RvD2 increased the fusion index
and the expression of myosin heavy chain (MyHC), a marker of terminal differentiation,
while knockdown of the cannabinoid receptor Gpr18 blocked RvD2 promyogenic effects
via downregulation of the Akt-mTOR pathway [83].
Altogether, these results show the promising effects of n-3 PUFAs and their derived
metabolites, specifically the oxylipins, to sustain myogenesis during inflammatory condi-
tions, at least in part via activation of the Akt-mTOR pathway and inhibition of proinflam-
matory signals. Whether n-3 derived endocannabinoids share similar actions in muscle
cells remains to be elucidated; however, there is a growing body of evidence showing that
these metabolites have greater anti-inflammatory properties compared with EPA, DHA,
or the n-6-derived endocannabinoids. Future studies should determine whether n-3 and
n-6-derived endocannabinoids positively regulate the myogenic process.
The positive effects of n-3 PUFAs and their derived metabolites on myogenesis and
regeneration in muscle cells have also been observed in rodent muscle tissue. For example,
Machado et al. [59] observed that 14-day-old mdx mice—a model of Duchenne muscle
dystrophy—treated with 300 mg/kg of EPA for 16 days resulted in a decrease in plasma
creatine kinase levels and TNF-αmuscle protein content concomitantly with a decline
in myonecrotic fibers.  Further studies from this group corroborated these findings and
provided new evidence showing that EPA and/or DHA in mdx mice attenuated the loss
of muscle function [84], and increased muscle regenerative capacity by augmenting the
levels of MyoD [85]. In parallel, this treatment increased M1-to-M2 macrophage phenotype
transition [86,87], decreased inflammation via changes in serum levels of proinflammatory
(IFN-γ) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines [86], and diminished muscle oxidative
141

Nutrients2023,15, 871
stress through downregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase protein [86] and 4-HNE-
protein adducts [84]. Not surprisingly, similar findings have also been observed in other
rodent models of muscle damage such as high-fat diet [88] and cardiotoxin-induced gas-
trocnemius muscle injury [89]. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, no study has identified
whether the positive changes in myogenesis observed after n-3 PUFA administration are
mediated by their derived metabolites, the oxylipins and endocannabinoids; however,
recent evidence has shown a promising role of the oxylipin derived from n-3 PUFA, the
RVs, as a potential molecule to enhance muscle regeneration.
Mdx mice treated with 5μg/kg/d of RvD2 or prednisone, the gold-standard treatment
of Duchenne muscle dystrophy, showed reduced neutrophil accumulation and levels of
the proinflammatory M1-macrophages (40–50%), and concomitantly increased presence
of proregenerative M2- macrophages [83]. Surprisingly, while prednisone administration
did not affect the pool of myogenic cells, RvD2 administration induced a ~2-fold increase
in the total number of myogenic cells and 2–3-fold increase in the number of Myog+ dif-
ferentiated myoblasts.  Furthermore,  assessment of global physical function using the
hang test revealed that RvD2 treated mice showed greater global physical function on
days 7 and 21 compared with prednisone-treated mdx mice [
83].  In a mouse model of
barium chloride (BaCl
2
)-induced muscle injury, an intraperitoneal injection of RvD1 re-
sulted in diminished accumulation of CD68+ macrophages; reduced mRNA expression
of the proinflammatory molecules Il-6, IL-1βMCP-1, and TNF-α; expedited clearance of
polymorphonuclear cells; and enhanced macrophage phagocytosis [21].  These changes
translated in enhanced myofiber regeneration and improved recovery (+15%) of muscle
strength. Similarly, cardiotoxin-induced muscle (i.e., tibialis anterior, TA) injury, intramus-
cular administration of 200 pg RvD2 increased M2 and decreased M1 macrophages after
2 and 3 days of muscle injury [20].  As a result, RvD2 administration improved muscle
(i.e., TA) force recovery by 50% and muscle mass by 17% after 8 and 14 days of cardiotoxin
injury. Finally, in aged mice, daily intraperitoneal injection of RvD1 after intramuscular
injection of BaCl
2
blunted inflammatory cytokine expression and accumulation of fibrotic
tissue in TA muscle [67]. This strategy improved muscle-specific force recovery. However,
myofiber regeneration was not enhanced when assessed by centrally located nuclei and
expression of embryonic myosin heavy chain.
Collectively, these results suggest that in different rodent models of muscle damage, n-
3 PUFAs and the D-series resolvins may enhance skeletal muscle regeneration via decreased
inflammation and reduced oxidative stress. Whether other oxylipins and endocannabinoids
derived from the n-3 PUFAs, including the RvE series, MaRs, PrTs, EPG, EPEA, and DHEA,
play a role in the muscle regeneration process remains to be elucidated, as well as whether
the beneficial effects of n-3 PUFAs on myogenesis are mediated by an increased production
of oxylipins and endocannabinoids.
5. Clinical Interventions Supporting the Consumption of n-3 PUFAs to Aid
Muscle Recovery
A common approach to investigating the muscle regeneration capacity is by induc-
ing damage through repeated efforts of maximal to near-maximal eccentric lengthening
contractions—a force applied to the muscle that exceeds the torque produced by the muscle
itself [90]. The high mechanical stress induced by these contractions leads to focal microle-
sions of the sarcomeres as well as the extracellular matrix and connective tissue of the mus-
cle fibers [91], which manifests itself by a range of clinical symptoms such as delayed-onset
muscle soreness (DOMS), muscle stiffness, swelling, decreased proprioceptive function,
and loss in maximal force-generating capacity [92]. Moreover, eccentric exercise-induced
muscle damage (EIMD) leads to systemic and local inflammatory responses that initially
were considered detrimental, albeit similar to the response to pathogens or local injuries. It
is now well established that the inflammatory stages are crucial for optimal recovery, as they
ensure the removal of tissue debris and promote muscle regeneration via the regulation
142

Nutrients2023,15, 871
of different immune cells and activation of SCs. In this context, n-3 PUFAs and their lipid
mediators may play a significant role in this process.
The effect of n-3 PUFA supplementation after eccentric damaging exercise has been
assessed in some studies. Interestingly, the majority have been performed in healthy young
to middle-aged males and have used a wide range of supplementation doses (<1 g up to
6 g/day) and supplementation times (from days to 8 weeks).  Despite this, most of the
studies have shown that n-3 PUFAs induce slightly faster recovery of muscle function and
muscle soreness after EIMD [63,93–101]. For instance, Kyriakidou et al. [102] showed that
4 weeks of n-3 PUFA supplementation successfully attenuated minor aspects of EIMD,
although it did not improve performance. Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses
have corroborated the efficacy of n-3 PUFAs in reducing DOMS and markers of muscle
damage [
103,104]; however, only a few studies have found significantly lower maximal
muscle strength loss or recovery (i.e., maximal voluntary contraction; MVC), indicated
as the best indirect marker of muscle damage, probably because of a poor control of the
participants’ diet characteristics affecting the n-6/n-3 ratio and the use of a broad range of
supplementation doses and times. Therefore, more studies assessing MVC after damage
are warranted.
Systemically, EIMD is paralleled by an inflammatory response involving many media-
tors, such as interleukin−1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and acute
phase proteins [105,106]. Kyriakidou et al. [102] supplemented healthy young individuals
with 3.9 g/d of fish oil containing3gofn-3PUFA(2.145 g of EPA and 0.858 g DHA) per day
for a period of 4 weeks (n= 7) and induced damaging exercise (downhill running; 60 min
at 65%
 ̇
V
O2max with a−10% gradient), and found a reduced increase in IL-6 and a small
protective effect of supplementation with n-3 supplementation in muscle function markers.
To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet associated the faster recovery rates after
n-3 PUFA supplementation with changes in the levels of oxylipins and endocannabinoids.
Future research is warranted to determine the effect of longer time supplementations and
larger sample sizes.
The positive effects of n-3 PUFAs have also been observed in patients with Duchenne
muscular dystrophy (DMD). These patients lack dystrophin, an important structural skele-
tal muscle protein. This leads to progressive muscle weakness, chronic muscle degeneration,
infiltration of fat, and fibrosis, resulting in the loss of muscle mass and aberrant muscle
regeneration, decreasing muscle function, and causing premature death.  In a placebo-
controlled, double-blinded, randomized study, 28 patients with DMD were supplemented
with 2.9 g/d of n-3 PUFAs (n= 14) or sunflower oil (placebo,n= 14) for 6 months.  the
results showed that there was a tendency to decrease the loss of lean mass in patients
supplemented with n-3 PUFAs compared with the placebo group [107]. In another study
by the same group and same set of patients, leukocyte levels of IL-1βand IL-6 were de-
creased after n-3 PUFA supplementation [108]. In support of these findings, in a 24-week
supplementation with a multi-ingredient nutraceutical, including high concentrations of
DHA (1.2 g/d) and EPA (0.36 g/d), there was a reduced 6 min walk distance and increased
isokinetic knee extension in facioscapulohumeral and limb girdle muscle dystrophy pa-
tients when compared to a placebo group [109]. Serum CK levels decreased in all treated
groups, with a significant difference in DMD subjects. Conversely, an n3-PUFA-rich diet
performed worse than a MUFA-rich diet in MDX mice, suggesting that n3 PUFA may exac-
erbate stress in dystrophic skeletal muscle [110] potentially by increased fluidity of muscle
membranes.  However, in general, the evidence provided suggests that EPA and DHA
slow the progression of muscle loss and decrease muscle damage potentially via enhanced
muscle regeneration through the attenuation of proinflammatory mediators (Figure 3).
Whether these changes are mediated by n-3 PUFA oxylipins or endocannabinoids remains
to be elucidated.

6. Conclusions
We have summarized the existing data that support the potential role of n-3 PUFAs
and their lipid mediators (i.e., oxylipins and endocannabinoids) on skeletal muscle heal-
ing and regeneration.  There is a gap in knowledge regarding which n-3 PUFAs (EPA,
DHA, or a combination of both) and specific lipid mediators are involved in this pro-
cess.  Future human studies should be focused in establishing the relationship between
changes in membrane composition, endocannabinoid and oxylipin levels, and the changes
in regeneration capacity after muscle-damaging protocols using a long-term n-3 PUFA
supplementation period (>3 months) of at least 1 g/d (EPA and/or DHA) in healthy and/or
diseased populations.

Abstract:Objective: To determine the effectiveness of whey protein (WP) supplementation during
resistance exercise training (RET) vs. RET with or without placebo supplementation on skeletal muscle
mass, strength, and physical performance in older people with Sarcopenia.  Methods:  Electronic
searches in the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS, SPORTDiscus, Epistemonikos,
and CINAHL databases were performed until 20 January 2023. Randomized clinical trials conducted
on sarcopenic adults aged 60 or older were included. The studies had to compare the effectiveness of
the addition of supplements based on concentrated, isolated, or hydrolyzed whey protein during
RET and compare it with RET with or without placebo supplementation on skeletal muscle mass
and strength changes. The study selection process, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were
carried out by two independent reviewers. Results: Seven randomized clinical trials (591 participants)
were  included,  and  five  of  them  provided  data  for  quantitative  synthesis.   The  overall  pooled
standardized mean difference (SMD) estimate showed a small effect size in favor of RET plus WP for
skeletal muscle mass according to appendicular muscle index, with statistically significant differences
compared with RET with or without the placebo group (SMD = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.42;p= 0.01;
I
2
=0%,p= 0.42). The overall pooled mean difference (MD) estimate showed a significant difference
of +2.31 kg (MD = 2.31 kg; 95% CI, 0.01 to 4.6;p= 0.05;I
2
= 81%,p< 0.001) in handgrip strength in the
RET plus WP group compared with the RET group with or without placebo. The narrative synthesis
revealed discordance between the results of the studies on physical performance. Conclusions: WP
supplementation during RET is more effective in increasing handgrip strength and skeletal muscle
mass in older people with Sarcopenia compared with RET with or without placebo supplementation.
However, the effect sizes were small, and the MD did not exceed the minimally important clinical
difference.  The quality of the evidence was low to very low according, to the GRADE approach.
Further research is needed in this field.

1. Background
Sarcopenia is a condition characterized by decreased skeletal muscle mass, muscle
strength, and physical performance [
1].  Sarcopenia has been positively correlated with
elevated rates of disability,  hospitalization,  falls,  fractures, and mortality risk in older
adults [
2,3]. Compared with older adults without Sarcopenia, the deterioration of phys-
ical performance is 3 times higher,  and the mortality rate is 3.6 times higher in older
adults with Sarcopenia [3]. Individuals with Sarcopenia present an increased risk of hos-
pitalization for different adverse events [4].  For these reasons, preventing and treating
Sarcopenia is essential to reducing healthcare costs [4]. In this sense, different interventions
have been recommended, including exercise training and nutritional supplementation [5].
Progressive resistanceexercise training (RET) of moderate to high intensity is one of the
interventions with the highest degree of recommendation for the prevention and treatment
of Sarcopenia [6–8].
RET has been shown to increase skeletal muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical
performance in healthy older people or those with an increased risk of Sarcopenia [9–12].
Furthermore, RET has been shown to be superior in improving muscle strength of the
upper and lower extremities, handgrip strength, depressive symptoms, physical perfor-
mance, walking speed, and distance compared with other exercise modalities in healthy,
sarcopenic, and hospitalized older people [9–13].  In addition, RET is an excellent, cost-
effective modality for reducing frailty and the risk of falls in healthy older people [14,15].
Similar results have been observed in older people with Sarcopenia on muscle strength and
physical performance; however, the effects of RET on skeletal muscle mass are heteroge-
neous [16–18]. According to a recent meta-analysis, the effect of RET on skeletal muscle
mass is still controversial since RET showed a small effect size (SMD = 0.28) on lower limb
skeletal muscle mass but not overall or on upper limb skeletal muscle mass compared with
education or maintaining the daily lifestyle in people with Sarcopenia [16].
Another important recommendation to treat and/or prevent Sarcopenia is protein
supplementation [
5].  As in healthy older people [19,20], it has been suggested that oral
Whey Protein (WP) could maximize the effects of exercise and positively influence skeletal
muscle anabolism in people with Sarcopenia [21]. In older people, protein supplementation
has been shown to increase overall lean mass and handgrip strength only when combined
with RET [22]. For example, WP plus leucine intake has been shown to induce postprandial
increases in plasma amino acid levels and stimulate muscle protein synthesis in people
with Sarcopenia to a greater extent than any other protein source [23]. Regarding the use of
WP, a daily dose of 20–40 g combined with RET has been shown to increase biceps strength
and lower limb lean mass in post-menopausal women [24].
Although there is plausibility for the potential benefit of the combination of WP with
RET in older people with Sarcopenia, the magnitude of the effects on skeletal muscle mass,
muscle strength, and physical performance is still unknown.  Therefore, the aim of this
systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of WP supplementation during RET
vs. RET with or without placebo supplementation on skeletal muscle mass, muscle strength,
and physical performance in older people with Sarcopenia.
2. Methods
2.1. Protocol and Registration
The report of this research was carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) and the recommendations of the
Cochrane Manual of Systematic Reviews of Interventions [25,26]. The protocol of this sys-
tematic review was published in PROSPERO with the registration number CRD42023391714.
2.2. Eligibility Criteria
Studies that met the following inclusion criteria were eligible: (1) population: adults
60  years  of  age  or  older,  diagnosed  with  Sarcopenia  (low  skeletal  muscle  mass,  mus-
cle strength, and/or physical performance, according to the criteria of the international
151

Nutrients2023,15, 3424
consensus  of  EWGSOP  [1]  or  AWGSOP  [27]),  with  or  without  concomitant  diseases;
(2) intervention:addition of supplements based on concentrated, isolated, or hydrolyzed
WP during RET; RET was considered when the program training used machines, elastic
bands, or free weights with moderate to high intensity (equal to or greater than 60% of
1 repetitionmaximum (1RM), for a minimum of 6 weeks); (3) comparison: moderate and
high-intensity RET with or without placebo supplementation; (4) primary outcomes: skele-
tal muscle mass was measured using dual computed tomography scan, nuclear magnetic
resonance, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), bioimpedance, or anthropometry;
upper- and lower-limb muscle and grip strength were measured using dynamometry, 1RM,
or load cell; physical performance was considered a secondary outcome: measurements con-
ducted with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Timed Up and Go (TUG), and
walking speed were considered physical performance; and (5) types of studies: controlled
clinical trials or randomized clinical trials published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese.
Studies were excluded if: (1) They were conducted in people with presarcopenia or
dynapenia; (2) They were carried out with mixed samples of people with and without
Sarcopenia; or (3) They were published only in conference proceedings.
2.3. Information Sources
Electronic searches were performed in Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science (WOS), Em-
base, LILACS, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and Epistemonikos from the beginning of each
database until January 2023. In addition, manual searches were performed on the references
of the articles included in the electronic searches.
2.4. Search Strategies
Two independent reviewers (JP-N and CO-D) performed the electronic search in the
databases.  The search strategy was composed of the following MESH and free terms:
“Sarcopenia”, “Sarcopenic”, “Sarcopaenia”, “Sarcopen”, “Strength training”, “Strength
exercise”, “Weightlifting”, “Resistance training”, “Resistance exercise”, “Whey protein”,
“Protein supplement”, “Whey supplement”, “Whey intake”, “Protein intake”, “Controlled
Clinical Trial”, “Randomized controlled trial”, and “Clinical trial”. The search strategies for
each database can be reviewed in Table S1 (Supplementary Materials).
2.5. Study Selection
The study selection process was carried out through the Rayyan collaborative web
application [
28]. Duplicates were eliminated before starting the article selection process.
Subsequently, two independent reviewers (JP-N and CO-D) reviewed the titles and abstracts
of the studies. Studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria were discarded. Potentially
eligible studies were reviewed for full text. The agreement rate between reviewers for the
study selection process was calculated using the Kappa statistic. Discrepancies between
the reviewers’ assessments were discussed with a third reviewer (CV-A).
2.6. Data Collection Process
Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers (JP-N and I-CV).
The following information was extracted: Characteristics of the population (sample size,
age, health status, and level of physical activity); intervention (type of intervention, supple-
ments, dosage); and results (skeletal muscle mass, muscle strength, walking speed, physical
performance, and dynamic balance).
2.7. Risk of Bias
Two independent reviewers (JP-N and WS-L) assessed studies using the Cochrane
Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool [29]. ROB 2 has six domains: bias arising from the randomization
process; bias due to deviations from intended interventions; bias due to missing outcome
data; bias in measurement of the outcome; bias in selection of the reported result; and
overall bias.  Each domain could be considered “low risk”, “some concerns”, or “high
152

Nutrients2023,15, 3424
risk” [29].  Discrepancies between reviewers’ assessments were discussed with a third
reviewer (IC-V).
2.8. Statistical Methods
A  quantitative  synthesis  was  performed  if  there  were  at  least  three  studies  with
comparable data.  There were insufficient data to perform a meta-analysis of upper and
lower limb strength (1RM), walking speed, SPPB, and TUG. A narrative synthesis of the
effects of the interventions on physical performance was performed according to walking
speed, SPPB, and TUG. A quantitative synthesis was performed for the skeletal muscle mass
and handgrip strength outcomes. Mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences
(SMD) were calculated for each group. The calculation of the effect sizes considered the use
of the raw baseline SD. A pooled estimate of the MD with 95% confidence intervals was
calculated for handgrip strength (kg). A pooled estimate of the SMD with 95% confidence
intervals was calculated for the appendicular muscle index and handgrip. The weighted
sample size method was used to summarize effect sizes from multiple independent studies.
Fixed-effects models with Mantel–Haenszel method or random-effects models with the
DerSimonian-Laird method were used depending on the degree of heterogeneity.TheI
2
statistic was used to assess heterogeneity.  For skeletal muscle mass, the effect size was
considered trivial (SMD < 0.2),  small (SMD 0.2–0.5),  medium (SMD 0.6–0.8),  or large
(SMD > 0.8) [
30].  Due to the lack of data for people with Sarcopenia, the threshold of
6.5 kg was considered a minimally important clinical difference for handgrip strength [31].
Subgroups wereanalyzed  according  to  intervention  time.   Statistical  significance  was
considered with apvalue < 0.05.  In the case of missing data, the reviewers contacted
the authors by email.  Meta-analysis would be performed using RevMan Manager 5.4
(Copenhagen, The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration).
2.9. Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation
The synthesis and quality of evidence for skeletal muscle mass and muscle strength
were assessed using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Eval-
uation (GRADE) [
32]. GRADE profile allows one to categorize the evidence as high, moder-
ate, low, or very low quality [33]. Results of the GRADE analysis are shown in Table S3.
3. Results
3.1. Study Selection
A total of 1047 articles were found through electronic searches.  Before starting the
screening, 567 duplicate articles were eliminated, and a total of 480 articles were reviewed
by title and abstract. Subsequently, 18 articles were reviewed in full text. The causes for
the exclusion of articles can be seen in Table S2 (Supplementary Materials). Finally, seven
randomized clinical trials were included [34–40]. The agreement rate between reviewers
reached a kappa value of 0.91. Details of the study selection process are shown in Figure 1.

3.2. Study Characteristics
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the studies. The general population consisted
of 591 people, 399 (67.5%) women, and 192 men (32.5%). The average age of the popula-
tion was 77.3 years.  All studies included untrained older adults.  Four studies reported
the inclusion of patients with comorbidities but did not report the details [
34,36,37,40].
Three studies reported the inclusion of patients with obesity, hypertension, diabetes melli-
tus, dyslipidemia, osteoarthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, fractures,
or a history of surgery [35,38,39]. Six studies were conducted in a hospital [34–38,40], or
university outpatient setting [39]. Five studies included outpatients [34,35,38–40] and two
included a mixed sample of inpatients and outpatients [36,37].

The duration of the intervention in the studies was 8 weeks [35], 12 weeks [34,36–39],
or 24 weeks [40]. The studies used isolated [36,37] or hydrolyzed WP [39], and four studies
did not report the type of WP [
34,35,38,40]. Supplementation doses were 10–35 g. One study
reported only the total protein count but did not detail the grams or percentage of WP [40].
Daily servings of WP ranged from 1–3 times per day. One study added no other ingredients
to WP supplementation, while others added leucine [
34–37,40], mineral vitamins [34,35,38],
and/or essential polyunsaturated fatty acids [38].  Regarding the control groups, four
studies added maltodextrin formulas supplementation to RET [34–37,39], and two studies
used only RET [38,40]. The WP supplementation was performed in three studies only on
training days [36,37,39]. In four studies, WP supplementation was administered every day
during or after meals [34,35,38,40].
Regarding RET, four studies performed progressive RET until reaching 70% of
1RM [36,37,39,40]. One study used conventional RET with an intensity of 80% of 1RM [38].
Two studies used a conventional RET with moderate intensity (Borg 12–14) [34,35]. The fre-
quency of RET sessions varied from 2–5 days per week. The duration of the RET sessions
ranged from 20 to 60 min.  Studies used machine, free weight, body weight, or elastic
band training.
Five  studies  assessed  skeletal  muscle  mass  via  DEXA  [33–36]  or  multi-frecuency
bioelectrical impedance analysis [38,40]. Muscle strength was evaluated in seven studies.
The studies used handgrip dynamometry [34–38,40], 1RM [39], and maximum voluntary
isometric contraction [40]. Five studies evaluated physical performance through different
tests: SPPB [35,36], TUG [35], 10-m walk test [39], walk speed with 4 m test [35], and usual
walking speed [40]. Regarding the confounding variables, four studies [34,35,39,40] and
one study [40] controlled the diet intake and the physical activity during the execution of
the interventions, respectively.
3.3. Risk of Bias Assessment
Figures 2 and 3 show the results of the risk of bias assessment. As far as “overall bias” is
concerned, 14.3% of the studies had a “low risk” and 85.7% had a “high risk”. Regarding the
randomization process, 85.7% showed low risk, and 14.3% had some concerns. In the item
deviations from intended interventions, 42.9% of the studies showed a low risk, 28.6%
some concerns, and 28.6% a high risk. The studies showed a low risk of bias in 57.1% and
a high risk of bias in 42.9% of the items missing outcome data. All studies showed a low
risk of bias in the measurement of the outcome. In relation to the selection of the reported
result, 14.3% of the studies showed a low risk, 57.1% some concerns, and 28.6% a high risk.

3.4. Synthesis of Results
3.4.1. Skeletal Muscle Mass: Appendicular Muscle Index
Five studies included data on appendicular muscle index to perform the meta-
analysis [
34–36,38,40].  The overall pooled SMD estimate showed a small effect size in
favor of RET plus WP supplementation with statistically significant differences compared
with RET with or without the placebo group at 4–24 weeks (SMD = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.05 to
0.42;
p= 0.01).  No important heterogeneity was observed (I
2
= 0%,p= 0.42) (Figure 4).
There was a low quality of evidence, according to the GRADE rating.  It was observed
that  weekly  SMD  varied  between  -0.01  and  0.13  in  favor  of  the  RET  plus  WP  group
(
Table S4, Supplementary Materials).  Four studies [34–36,38] with interventions lasting
4–12 showeda small effect size in favor of RET plus WP; however, there were no statistically
significant differences compared with RET with or without a placebo group (SMD = 0.26;
95% CI, 0.05 to 0.47;p= 0.02), with no important heterogeneity (I
2
= 11%,p= 0.34) (Figure 5).
There was a low quality of evidence, according to the GRADE rating.

Three studies [34,36,38] that included data on appendicular muscle mass to perform
the meta-analysis showed a small effect size in favor of RET plus WP, however, without
statistically significant differences compared with RET with or without the placebo group

3.4.3. Muscle Strength
Five studies included data on handgrip strength to perform the meta-analysis [34–36,38,40].
The overall pooled MD estimate showed a difference of +2.31 kg in handgrip strength in
the RET plus WP supplementation compared with the RET group with or without placebo
supplementation at 4–24 weeks, with statistically significant differences (MD = 2.31 kg;
95% CI, 0.01 to 4.6;p= 0.05) and considerable heterogeneity (I

= 81%,p< 0.001)(Figure 6).
There was a very low quality ofevidence, according to the GRADE rating. Four stud-
ies [
34–36,38] with interventions lasting 4–12 weeks showed a difference of +2.71 kg in
handgrip strength in the RET plus WP group compared with the RET group with or
without placebo supplementation at 4–24 weeks, with statistically significant differences
(MD = 2.71 kg;  95% CI, 0.06 to 5.36;p= 0.05) and considerable heterogeneity (I

= 80%,
p= 0.002) (Figure 6).There was a very low quality of evidence, according to theGRADE rating.

3.4.4. Physical Performance
Two  studies  evaluated  walking  speed  at  four  weeks  [35]  and  24  weeks  [40].
Mori et al.  (2022) found no difference between groups [
40].  However, Rondanelli et al.
(2020) showed statistically significant improvements in walking speed in favor of the RET
plus WP supplementation [35]. Three studies evaluated physical performance according
to SPPB at four [35] and 12 weeks [36,37].  Amasene et al.  (2021) observed no difference
between groups [
36].  However, Rondanelli et al.  (2020) showed statistically significant
improvements in physical performance in favor of the RET plus WP group [35]. Only one
160

Nutrients2023,15, 3424
study evaluated dynamic balance through the TUG test at four weeks [35]. The results indi-
cated that the RET plus WP group was statistically more effective in improving dynamic
balance [35].
4. Discussion
The aim of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of WP sup-
plementation during RET vs. RET with or without placebo supplementation on skeletal
muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance in older people with Sarcopenia.
Our results indicate that WP supplementation associated with RET is effective in increasing
skeletal muscle mass according to the appendicular muscle index, and handgrip strength.
However, we did not observe differences in appendicular muscle mass between RET plus
WP supplementation and RET with or without placebo supplementation.  In addition,
the increase in handgrip strength did not exceed the minimally important clinical differ-
ence [31]. There were insufficient data to perform a meta-analysis on physical performance.
The results of the studies were discordant in relation to physical performance.
The effectiveness of adding WP supplementation during RET has been well studied in
other older populations [
19,20,22,24]. However, systematic reviews focused on older people
with Sarcopenia are scarce. In this sense, our results differ partially from the findings of the
systematic review by Chang and Choo (2023), whose aim was to evaluate the effectiveness
of WP, leucine, and vitamin D supplementation in patients with Sarcopenia [41]. Based on
two studies, the meta-analysis by Chang and Choo (2023) showed statistically significant
differences in favor of the WP, leucine, and vitamin D group, with moderate effect sizes
for skeletal muscle mass and large effect sizes for handgrip strength.  The findings of
Chang and Choo (2023) are likely to have overestimated effect sizes.  Even though our
findings are supported by a larger number of studies, the certainty of the evidence demon-
strates the need to improve the methodological quality of future studies to obtain more
accurate conclusions.
The small increases in skeletal muscle mass and handgrip strength in older people
with Sarcopenia could be due to several factors.  There are reports demonstrating that
older people performing RET (with and without Sarcopenia) present a higher percentage
increase in muscle strength than in skeletal muscle mass [42,43]. Additionally, these results
could be explained by the characteristics of the sample, the dosage of the interventions,
and the scant control of confounding variables, including physical activity and diet intake.
Regarding the characteristics of the sample, 69.25% (n= 265) of the participants included in
our meta-analysis were women. Furthermore, 2/7 of the studies included in this systematic
review were conducted only on women [34,37]. This is relevant since it has been observed
that older women with Sarcopenia tend to show a lower increase in skeletal muscle mass
with RET [44].  On the other hand, the blunted stimulation of muscle protein synthesis
rates is known as anabolic resistance, and it has been suggested as a theoretical framework
to support interventions in people with Sarcopenia [45].   Aging anabolic resistance is
influenced by factors such as digestion, absorption, anabolic signaling proteins, muscle
perfusion, splanchnic amino acid sequestration, physical activity levels, and postprandial
amino acid availability and delivery [45]. Because of these factors, it has been suggested
that a greater amount of WP supplementation (~40 g) [46] together with a RET program
could be more effective in increasing skeletal muscle mass.  However, the dose of WP
ranged from 10 to 22 g in the studies included in the meta-analysis [34–36,38,40].
We know that to build skeletal muscle mass, the amount and quality of food consumed
(diet) are important. It has been reported that older people with Sarcopenia have alterations
in their usual diet intake [
47–50]. However, only three studies controlled diet intake during
the intervention period [34,35,40].  In addition, it is well known that levels of physical
activity can decrease anabolic resistance, thus increasing the effectiveness of nutritional
and exercise interventions [45]. However, only the study by Mori et al. (2022) monitored
the levels of physical activity and diet intake before and after the intervention. They found
that levels of physical activity and diet intake did not change after the intervention in either
161

Nutrients2023,15, 3424
group [40]. Their results indicated that there were no differences between RET and RET
plus WP supplementation in improving handgrip strength, knee extension strength, and
relative skeletal muscle mass [40].
RET programming,  to obtain gains in skeletal muscle mass and muscle strength,
must be individualized, progressive, and of moderate-high intensity (70–80% of 1RM).
However, several studies included in this systematic review performed moderate RET
or adapted strength training by performing it with elastic bands or sandbags [
35,38,40].
Additionally, training frequency could also influence the effects of RET on skeletal mus-
cle mass.  For example, Rondanelli et al.  (2016; 2020) conducted training sessions five
times a week and found statistically significant differences in appendicular muscle mass
and relative skeletal muscle mass in favor of RET plus WP supplementaion. In contrast,
studies that had 2–3 weekly sessions found no differences between the groups after the
intervention [35,36,38]. Finally, current evidence shows us that evaluating skeletal muscle
mass through a Computed Tomography Scan or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (especially
changes in the thigh of older people) could be a better way to see changes [51].
Insufficient and controversial scientific evidence exists on the effect of WP supple-
mentation combined with RET on physical performance [35,36,40]. Rondanelli et al. (2020)
showed that an intervention with RET plus WP supplementation induces positive effects
on walking speed, physical performance using SPPB, and dynamic balance using TUG in
older adults with Sarcopenia. This intervention also reduces hospitalization time, which is
related to decreased healthcare expenditures and different adverse events associated with
hospitalization time [4]. However, the other two studies did not report significant differ-
ences in favor of WP supplementation plus RET compared with placebo supplementation
plus RET [36,40]. Mori et al. (2022) reported no benefit in both interventions in improving
walking speed [40], and Amasene et al. (2021) [36] reported that the physical performance
measured using SPPB significantly improved in both intervention groups regardless of
protein-enriched supplementation. Nonetheless, in that study [36], the intervention group
demonstrated a decrease in the prevalence of frailty, as evidenced by five older adults
supplemented with protein who were classified as frail at baseline but were no longer so
after the intervention [36]. The results reported by Amasene et al. (2021) [36] emphasize
the effectiveness of RET programs alone in improving the physical performance of older
adults, as also reported in a recent systematic review [52]. Therefore, the addition of WP
supplementation during RET may not be necessary to achieve significant improvements
in physical performance among this population, and additional studies are required in
this research field to fully understand of the role of WP supplementation on physical
performance during RET.
Finally, the role of WP supplementation in the treatment of Sarcopenia has been previ-
ously recommended by international consensus [1,27]. Prior research has suggested that
physical exercise is beneficial for individuals with Sarcopenia; however, it may not be
sufficient alone to achieve significant clinical outcomes. As a result, a combined exercise
program along with supplementation of WP, essential amino acids, and vitamin D has
shown significant effects when compared with exercise alone [34]. That study highlights
the potential benefits of combined interventions to treat Sarcopenia and improve clinical
outcomes. Although physical performance is an important clinical measurement to diag-
nose Sarcopenia and is recommended by international consensus, it was measured only in
two studies [34,35]. Therefore, more studies to analyze the effect on all clinical measure-
ments of Sarcopenia (skeletal muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance)
are necessary.
Limitations
Our results should be considered with caution due to the following limitations: First,
despite searching eight databases, articles in other languages than English, Spanish, or
Portuguese could have been excluded.   Second,  the studies have shown high clinical
heterogeneity in terms of WP supplementation and RET dosing. Third, due to the small
162

Nutrients2023,15, 3424
number of articles included in the quantitative synthesis, the accuracy of the meta-analytic
tests  used  may  be  affected.   Fourth,  although  it  is  a  consequence  of  the  high  clinical
heterogeneity of the studies, the quantitative syntheses showed considerable statistical
heterogeneity for handgrip strength.  Fifth, it was not possible to perform a moderator
analysis and assess publication biases due to the limited number of articles included in
the meta-analyses.
5. Conclusions
RET plus WP supplementation is more effective in increasing skeletal muscle mass
and handgrip strength in older people with Sarcopenia compared with RET with or without
placebo supplementation. However, the effect sizes were small for skeletal muscle mass,
and the handgrip strength did not exceed the minimally important clinical difference.
The quality of the evidence was low to very low,  according to the GRADE approach.
Further studies are needed in this research field. Future research should report in detail the
dosage and periodization of RET program, as well as the proportions of other ingredients
that are incorporated into WP supplementation. Higher doses of WP supplementation and a
higher frequency of intake could probably improve the results obtained to date. Changes in
physical activity and diet intake are confounding variables that future studies should
control for. Strategies to avoid participant dropout, blinding, and reporting according to
clinical trial registration protocols could reduce the risk of bias.
