SHORTCUT TO SIZE
The  12-week  program  I  am  about  to  take  you  through  
is  based  on  one  of  the  oldest,  tried  and  true  methods  
for  gaining  strength  and  muscle.  This  type  of  training  
has successfully prepared almost every type of athlete 
imaginable, from Olympic weightlifters to soccer players. 
It  works  so  well  that  it  has  been  used  continually  for  
decades. 
I  know  that  I  am  best  known  for  my  unique  exercises  
and  novel  training  programs,  but  sometimes  you  have  
to rely on the basics. That’s especially true when a basic 
program works as well a this one. Of course, I have taken 
the basic, but very effective program and tweaked it to 
perfect its effectiveness and to maximize the results 
you get. These results include greater strength, bigger 
muscles, and less body fat. 
PERIODIZATION WORKS... PERIOD!
This  program  is  based  on  the  training  concept  called  
periodization. Periodization is the method of changing 
up  your  training  at  specified  time  points.  The  very 
first  periodized  scheme  to  be  used  with  weights  is 
called  Linear  Periodization  (also  known  as  Classc 
Periodization). That simply means that you start with light 
weight  and  high  reps  and  as  the  program  progresses  
the weights used get heavier and heavier and the reps 
completed per set get fewer and fewer. Most periodized 
programs  take  many  months  to  complete.  Many  last  
anywhere  from  4  to  12  months  to  complete  the  cycle.  
But this periodized program utilizes a concept known as 
microcycles. Where a typical linear periodized scheme 
might  stick  with  the  same  weight  and  rep  range  for  a  
month or longer, the micro cycles change up the weight 
and rep ranges every week.
In week one your rep range will be 12-15 reps. In week 
two  you  bump  up  all  the  weights  and  drop  reps  down  
to 9-11. Week three adds weight again to each exercise 
to  drop  the  rep  range  down  to  6-8.  And  in  week  four  
you  bump  the  weight  up  again  to  drop  reps  down  to  
3-5 per set. Those are the four microcycles that you will 
repeat. On the fourth week you have completed the first 
4-week phase. On the fifth week you drop the weight 
back down and start all over at 12-15 reps per set. This is 
the start of Phase 2. But now you will be able to do each 
rep range with at least 5 and up to 20 pounds more than 
you could in Phase 1. In the sixth week, or week 2 of 
Phase 2, you will be back at 9-11 reps per set. In week 
7, or week 3 of phase 2, weight will go up again to drop 
your repa down to 6-8 per set. And in week 8, or week 4 
of phase 2, weight will go up to limit reps to 3-5 per set. 
That completes Phase 2. And in week 9 you start The 
final phase, phase 3 by dropping back down to 12-15 
reps per set and run through the four microcycles again 
until you are back down at 3-5 reps per set. Of course, 
in each phase you will be using 5-20 pounds more than 
you  did  in  phase  2  and  10-40  pounds  more  than  you  
used in Phase 1. This is how you get stronger... Much 
stronger, over this 12-week program. 
The  constant  increase  in  weight  each  week  and  the  
recycling  of  these  four  phases  leads  to  impressive  
strength  gains.  The  microcyles  also  lead  to  muscle  
hypertrophy due to the constant changing up of the rep 
ranges  each  and  every  week.  Another  reason  for  the  
strength and mass gains has to do with the fact that you 
keep the weight steady on each exercise for all sets and 
you are forced to complete the minimum number of reps 
in that rep range. 
Greater   gains   in   strength   and   muscle   mass   are   
guaranteed   with   this   program.   I   have   seen   some   
impressive results with this program. In men, I have seen 
gains of strength over 90 pounds on the squat and over 
50  pounds  on  the  bench  press.  And  for  muscle,  some  
guys have gained over 15 pounds of muscle. Yes, pure 
muscle,  while  actually  dropping  body  fat.  Speaking  of  
body fat, when maximizing body fat with my training 
and diet tweaks some men have lost over 20 pounds of 
body fat. And women have also seen impressive gains 
in  strength  and  muscle  while  losing  body  fat.  Women  
following   my   program   have   increased   their   squat   
strength by over 60 pounds, and bench press strength 
by  30  pounds.  And  gains  in  muscle  of  over  10  pounds  
and fat loss over 10 pounds.
But I’m not the only one to report insane gains in muscle 
size  and  strength  with  concomittant  losses  in  body 
fat. Researchers from Federal University of Sao Carlos 
(Sao Paulo, Brazil) reported impressive results using a 
similar microcycle linear periodization program for 12 
weeks.  They  had  one  group  of  female  athletes  follow  
a linear periodization program with weekly microcycles 
repeating  three  times  for  a  total  of  12  weeks  and  a  
second  group  following  a  reverse  linear  periodized 
program with microcycles for 12 weeks. While the linear 
periodized group started with 12-14 reps per set and 
ended  each  phase  with  4-6  reps  per  set,  the  reverse  

WWW.BODYBUILDING.COM/SHORTCUT
linear  group  started  each  phase  with  4-6  reps  and  
ended  with  12-14.  They  measured  their  muscle  mass,  
body fat and strength on bench presses, lat pulldowns, 
barbell  curls,  and  leg  extensions  before  and  after  the  
12  weeks.  They  reported  that  the  linear  group  gained  
7 pounds of lean muscle mass while the reverse group 
only gained 3 pounds of muscle. The linear group also 
lost over 5 pounds of body fat while the reverse group 
lost  a  little  over  3  pounds  of  body  fat.  Although  both  
groups  increased  strength  on  all  exercises,  the  linear  
group made greater gains than the reverse group.
The first exercise you do for each muscle group (except 
for abs and calves) will remain constant throughout all 
12  weeks.  This  is  the  exercise  that  you  are  focusing  
on  increasing  your  strength  on.  Most  of  the  assistance  
exercises that follow the first exercise will change every 
phase.  For  abs,  the  exercises  will  change  each  week  
based  on  the  rep  ranges.  This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  
some ab exercises are easier to do for higher reps, while 
some are difficult to do for lower reps. So I organized the 
best ab exercises for the prescribed rep ranges.
GET FOCUSED
As   I   already   mentioned,   this   program   works   well   
to  increase  the  three  main  goals  that  we  all  have  –  
increasing muscle strength, boosting muscle size, and 
enhancing  fat  loss.  To  boost  muscle  mass  as  much  as  
possible,  we’ll  be  using  two  intensity  techniques:  rest-
pause and dropsets. 
Focus:  Maximizing  Muscle  Growth  – During   weeks  
one and two of each phase of the program, you will do 
one  rest-pause  on  the  last  set  of  each  exercise.  To  do  
this,  reach  muscle  failure  on  the  last  set,  then  rack  the  
weight and rest 15 seconds. Then continue the set until 
you reach muscle failure again. During weeks three and 
four of all phases, you will do a drop set on the last set 
of each exercise. To do this, take the last set to muscle 
failure  then  immediately  reduce  the  weight  to  the  
amount  you  used  for  that  exercise  during  week  1,  and  
continue the set until failure again.

Of course, there is a time or two when you want to focus 
on fast-digesting carbs. The first time is right when you 
wake up. Getting in fast carbs at this time will send those 
carbs straight to your liver, which will tell your body to stop 
burning up muscle protein for fuel. Yes, the bad news is 
that when you sleep, you go so long without eating that 
your body feeds on your muscle for fuel. But getting in fast 
carbs like cantaloupe (one of the few fast fruits, along with 
watermelon) will stop it quickly. Even other fruits that are 
low-glycemic  or  slow-digesting,  such  as  apples,  berries,  
oranges, etc... make a good carb choice when you wake. 
One of the main reasons that fruit is low glycemic is the 
fructose content. Fructose has to go to the liver first to 
be converted to glucose (blood sugar). That is one of the 
main reasons why most fruits are “slow”. But the fructose 
still gets to your liver fairly quickly and signals your liver to 
stop burning muscle for fuel. Of course, with these carbs 
you’ll need to add a fast-acting protein, like Pro Jym, to 
stop the breakdown of muscle protein and replace some 
of  the  lost  aminos.  This  also  happens  to  be  the  reason  
why you will go with a protein shake right before bed. The 
slow-digesting proteins found in Pro Jym will give you a 
long and steady supply of amino acids throughout most 
of the night so your body doesn’t eat up as much muscle 
protein for fuel. The only other time you want fast carbs is 
right after the workout. Here you want those carbs to not 
only  quickly  replenish  the  carbs  you  burned  during  the  
workout,  but  you  want  them  to  spike  insulin  levels.  The  
anabolic  hormone  insulin  drives  amino  acids  and  carbs  
(in the form of glucose) into the muscles for recovery and 
growth, and it also turns on the process of muscle protein 
synthesis (which is the biochemical steps that lead to 
muscle growth). So after workouts turn to fast carbs like 
gummy bears and other fat-free candy, white bread, white 
potatoes, or sports drinks.
The other issue with carbs is timing. You should focus the 
majority of your carb intake on the earlier parts of the day, 
like breakfast, lunch and the snacks you have up till the 
afternoon. When it comes to dinner, you should stick with 
vegetables  as  your  sides  and  skip  the  carby  potatoes,  
rice, breads and pastas. Also keep snacks after dinner to 
just protein and healthy fats. 
Speaking of healthy fats, you also need to get in ample 
amounts of fat, especially healthy fats like olive oil, egg 
yolks, omega-3 fats from salmon and other fatty fish, 
and peanut butter. These fats are not as readily stored 
as  body  fat  as  other  fats  and  are  readily  used  for  fuel  
during  exercise.  On  this  diet  your  total  daily  fat  intake  
will be about 0.5 grams per pound of body weight and 
about 30% of you total daily calories. Fat is also critical 
for keeping testosterone levels high.
SHORTCUT TO SIZE NUTRITION
Of course, as you well know by now, no training program 
is complete without a nutrition and supplement program 
to  work  with  it.  Training  is  just  half  the  equation  and  
nutrition is equally, if not more important for realizing 
your goals. But just as you can alter your training to focus 
more on a specific goal, you also need to alter your diet 
to better reach that goal. This diet is built for those who 
want to maximize muscle growth and strength gains. 
GAIN SIZE AND STRENGTH 
As   you   know   the   three   main   macronutrients   are:    
1) Protein, 2) Carbs and 3) Fat. As you’ve heard me 
state time and time again, protein is critical for building 
muscle  size  and  strength.  So  it  should  come  at  no 
surprise  that  this  diet  will  provide  you  ample  amounts  
of protein to pack on muscle and get you stronger and 
more powerful. The basic diet plan, which is meant for 
rest days, or days you are not training, will provide you 
about 1.5 grams of protein. This will keep you anabolic 
and  encourage  muscle  growth.  On  Workout  days  the  
addition of a pre and postworkout shake or my favorite, 
a  pre/during/postworkout  shake,  will  bring  your  total  
daily protein intake closer to 2 grams per pound, which 
will be the days that extra protein will ensure that you’re 
really kicking up muscle growth on those training days.
Carbs are the macronutrient we like to give the most 
credit to when it comes to providing us energy, especially 
when we work out. Yet, while carbs are critical for workout 
energy,  so  is  protein  and  fat.  Yes,  amino  acids  from  the  
protein you eat can be used for energy... and so can fat.  
I’ll get into this in just a minute. Back to carbs... to ensure 
you  have  ample  levels  of  energy  to  get  through  these  
workouts  and  recover  properly  from  them,  you  will  be  
getting  in  about  1.5  grams  of  carbs  per  pound  of  body  
weight on rest days, and a full 2 grams of carbs per pound 
on  workout  days.  To  provide  yourself  the  type  of  long-
lasting  energy  that  will  get  you  through  these  grueling  
workouts,  without  adding  body  fat,  you  should  focus  
mainly on slow-digesting carbs. Research studies confirm 
that when athletes consume slow-digesting carbs (such 
as fruit and whole grains) earlier in the day, such as at 
breakfast and lunch, they have more energy for workouts 
and can workout harder for longer, in addition they burn 
more fat during exercise and at rest sitting around. That is 
why this diet focuses on fruits, oatmeal, and whole-wheat 
bread.  These  carbs  will  keep  insulin  levels  low,  which  
means you have more stable and longer-lasting energy, 
and you will burn more fat.

The sample daily diet I provided is what a typical day will 
look  like  on  days  you  do  not  train.  This  is  for  a  typical  
180-pound guy, but will suffice for men and women 
between  160-200  pounds  who  want  to  build  more  
muscle and strength. If you weigh more or less than this 
range,  adjust  your  macronutrients  accordingly  for  your  
weight. 
On workout days, simply add the pre and postworkout 
meals (or do it as a pre/during/post workout meal) in 
around  your  workout  time.  If  you  train  close  to  one  of  
the  meal  times,  simply  replace  that  meal  with  the  pre  
workout  meal  and  follow  up  with  the  next  scheduled  
meal  about  1  hour  after  your  postworkout  meal.  For  
example, if you workout first thing in the morning, skip 
the shake and cantaloupe and go with the preworkout 
meal as your first meal. Then have breakfast one hour 
after the postworkout meal.

This will bring up the Totals to: 3700 calories, 335 g protein, 
340 g carbs, and fat stays at 110 grams (for the 180 pounder 
that = 21 cals/pound, about 1.8 grams of protein per pound, 
just  shy  of  2  grams  of  carbs  per  pound,  and  fat  stays  at  
about .5 grams per pound of body weight)
MEAL REPLACEMENTS
The diet I offer only shows one sample day. Given the 
fact that you are training four days per week and have 
3 rest days per week, you’ll be eating an additional 47 
workout days and 35 rest days. I do NOT recommend 
you eat the same meals for all of those days. You can 
mix it up and find foods that best suit your tastes and 
schedule. Consider this list as a good source to consider 
when you’re not looking forward to yet another piece 
of salmon or bowl of oats.
REPLACE ANY OF THE MEATS (SALMON OR TUNA) WITH ANY OF THESE:
chicken breast
chicken thighs
turkey breast
lean ground turkey
lean ground beef
tri-tip steak
flank steak
pork tenderloin
bison
salmon
trout
tilapia
shrimp
crab
lean deli turkey breast
lean deli ham
lean deli roast beef
REPLACE ANY OF THE DAIRY (COTTAGE CHEESE) WITH ANY OF THESE:
Although  cottage  cheese  is  one  of  the  best  forms  
of  dairy  because  it’s  so  high  in  protein,  you  can  also  
incorporate  these  dairy  foods  into  the  diet  (Greek 
yogurt comes in a close second to cottage cheese):
Greek yogurt
Low-fat or reduced-fat cheeses
plain low-fat yogurt
low-fat or reduced-fat milk
