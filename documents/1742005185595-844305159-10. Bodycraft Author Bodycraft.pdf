FUNCTIONAL TRAINING ARMS
 
BODYCRAFT was the first company to incorporate Functional Training 
Arms into the standard multi-function home gym.  This extremely versatile 
station opened up a vast array of exercises and we cannot imagine making a 
home strength training system without it.  Your Functional Training Arms 
provide exercises that pertain to everyday living.  You can train specifically 
for your favorite sport or activity, or for tasks required to help make it 
through your day.  We encourage you to be inventive with your Functional 
Training Arms.  You can easily invent motions unique to you.  Just be care-
ful to always be in control and work to balance your body. 
 
GENERAL EXERCISE GUIDELINES 
There are many theories as to the proper number of repetitions and sets 
of	repetitions	recommended	for	any	specific	exercise.		In	fact,	we	are	all	
unique individuals and what may be effective for one person may not be as 
effective for another.  Your genetic makeup, goals, and available time are all 
specific	to	you.		In	addition	to	reading	this	book,	we	recommend	consulta-
tions with 
fitness professionals such as a certified personal trainer and your local spe-
cialty fitness dealer.
 
 
The	human	body	is	a	highly	adaptive	machine.			It	can	quickly	adjust	to	
routine stresses.  Therefore, intensity and variety are vital components of 
any	strength	training	routine.		Intensity	is	more	important	than	a	specific	
number of repetitions or sets of repetitions.  The amount a muscle group 
is stressed (to failure) is directly proportional to the amount of increased 
strength	/	growth.		In	other	words,	the	more	effort	you	put	into	training,	
the more results you should receive!  Periodically changing the routine is 
also highly recommended.  Your body will become accustomed to a rou-
tine.  Variety will increase your results! 
 
Please remember to start easy and increase the total time and number of 
repetitions gradually.  Overdoing it in the beginning can cause unnecessary 
muscle	soreness.		If	at	any	time	you	feel	excessive	or	unnatural	pain,	stop	
immediately!  Determine what is wrong before continuing.  See your 
physician if you have any doubts. 
 
In	general	terms,	for	maximum	muscle	building,	we	recommend	6-12	
repetitions and 2-3 sets per exercise. For endurance training, We recom-
mend	12-	20	repetitions	and	2-3	sets	per	exercise.

CHEST
Bench Press
Adjust the seat back to the upright position.  Adjust the seat so that the 
bench press handles are even with your chest.  The bench press handles 
should be adjusted for a comfortable stretch, about even with the front 
of your chest.  Too far back can cause excessive strain on your shoul-
ders!  Grab the handles with an overhand grip and press away from 
your chest.  Do not lock out your elbows.  Return slowly. 
Variations: Use an underhand grip or a neutral grip.  Changing the 
grip does emphasize different areas of the muscle group. 
Primary muscles worked:	Pectorals	Major	and	Minor	(chest),	Anterior	
Deltoids (shoulder), Triceps (back of the arm).

CHEST
Cable Bench Press
Adjust the seat back to the upright position and the Functional Train-
ing Arms to chest height.  Sit upright, grab the cable handles with an 
overhand grip, and press away from your chest.  Return slowly. 
Variations: Use an underhand grip, neutral grip, or even twist your 
wrists (like a karate punch).  You can also vary the width of the Func-
tional Training Arms.  Changing the grip and width does emphasize 
different areas of the muscle group.  As with all cable oriented exercises, 
this exercise can be performed one arm at a time.
Primary muscles worked:	Pectorals	Major	and	Minor	(chest),	Anterior	
Deltoids (shoulder), Triceps (back of the arm).

comfort will determine which hole exactly.  Adjust the seat so that the 
bench press handles are even with your chest.  Sit back in the seat so 
that the seat back forces a forward lean.  The bench press handles should 
be adjusted for a comfortable stretch, about even with the front of your 
chest.  Too far back can cause excessive strain on your shoulders!  Grab 
the handles with an overhand grip and press away from your chest. 
Return slowly. 
Variations: Use an underhand grip, or neutral grip.  Changing the grip 
does emphasize different areas of the muscle group.

Leg Extension
Adjust the seat and the seat back so that, when seated, your knees are 
aligned with the pivot point on the leg extension lever arm.  Sit and 
hook your ankles behind the lower roller pads.  Grasp the handles, or 
the sides of the seat, and extend your legs to horizontal.  Return slowly.
Variations:  One leg at a time.
Primary muscles worked:  Quadriceps (front of upper leg)

53
LEGS
Standing Leg Curl
Stand facing the machine.   Adjust the seat so that the connected roller 
pads are above your knee.  Grab the seat back, or the press arm for 
stability.  Position your ankles behind the lower set of roller pads.  Us-
ing one leg at a time, bend your knee backward and upward as far as 
possible.  Return slowly.
Variations:	If	you	point	your	toe,	the	calf	muscle	is	less	involved.		If	
you bend your ankle while bending your knee, the calf muscle is more 
involved.
Primary muscles worked:	Hamstrings	(back	of	upper	legs),	Gastrocne-
mius (rear of calf).

LEGS
Seated Leg Curl
Note: This exercise is only available on the Elite model.
Adjust the seat to its lowest position.  Adjust the leg lever to its high-
est comfortable position by grabbing the attached handle and pulling the 
release lever with your middle finger.  Sit on the seat and place your ankles 
atop the lower roller pad, but under the middle set of roller pads.  Adjust 
the middle set of roller pads so that they are snug against your shins.  These 
pads will help keep your body in the proper position.  Grasp the handles 
and bend at the knee, pushing the roller pads down and toward the ma-
chine.  Return slowly.
Variations:		Pointing	your	toes	focuses	the	work	on	the	Hamstrings,	while	
flexing your feet also involves the Gastrocnemius.
Primary muscles worked:	Hamstrings	(back	of	upper	legs),	Gastrocnemius	
(rear of calf).

LEGS
Leg Press
This exercise can only be performed if you have purchased the optional 
leg press attachment.  Adjust the seat back to a comfortable posi-
tion.  You should try to get as close as possible to the foot plate, yet 
not so close that your knees are against your chest, forcing your knees 
outward.  Place your feet squarely on the foot plates and press outward 
to	full	extension.		Be	careful	not	to	lock	out	your	knees!		Locking	your	
knees is extending a bit too far and can result in injury.  Return slowly.
Primary muscles worked:  Entire leg!  Quadriceps (front of upper leg), 
Hamstrings	(back	of	upper	legs),	Gluteals	(rear	end),	Gastrocnemius	
(rear of calf), Soleus (lower part of calf).

56
LEGS
Calf Raise
Adjust the seat back on the leg press attachment so that your legs are 
almost fully extended when your feet are on the foot plates.  Do not lock 
your knees!  Place your feet on the foot plates so that the balls of your feet 
are aligned with the pivot on the foot plates.  While keeping your legs at 
full extension (remember, to not lock your knees), push outward, flexing 
at the ankle.  Return slowly.
Variations:  Angling your feet can target different areas of your calf 
muscles.  Angling outward will emphasize the inside of the calf muscles, 
while angling inward will emphasize the outside of the calf muscles.
Primary muscles worked:  Gastrocnemius (rear of calf), Soleus (lower 
part of calf).

57
LEGS
Hip Adduction
Stand next to the machine and attach the ankle strap to your back leg.  
Stand and grab the seat back, or press arm for support.  Using a full 
range of motion, pull your leg toward and across your support leg.  
Return slowly.
You can use either the low pulley station or one Functional Training 
Arm (adjusted to the lowest position) for this exercise.  We suggest us-
ing the Functional Training Arm as the weight ratio is half.
Primary muscles worked:  Adductors (inside of upper thigh).

58
LEGS
Hip Abduction
Stand next to the machine and attach the ankle strap to your front leg.  
Stand and grab the seat back, or press arm for support.  Using a full range 
of motion, pull your leg outward, away from your body.
You can use either the low pulley station or one Functional Training Arm 
(adjusted to the lowest position) for this exercise.  We suggest using the 
Functional Training Arm as the weight ratio is half.
Primary muscles worked:  Abductors (outside of upper thigh).

We only show a couple examples of sport specific training 
in this book.  Truth is, there are a large number of sport 
specific exercises that can be performed.  Feel free to 
invent	your	own.		Movements	mimicking	your	favorite	
activity, past time, or sport can aid your performance.  
Remember to always remain in control!  Please con-
sult your coach, or trainer.
