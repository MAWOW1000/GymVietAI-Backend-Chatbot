The important role of nutrition on both health and sports performance, and particularly
its joint association with physical exercise, is becoming increasingly clear in recent years.
The present Special Issue, entitled “Recent Advances in Nutrition for Disease Prevention
and Sports Performance Enhancement” reflects the great progress that is being made in
this field, including different studies that address important topics related to nutrition from
an integrative and multi-domain perspective.
On the one hand, we find studies focused on the role of nutrition for disease pre-
vention.  Xu et al.  find an association between the plasma levels of oxylipins (i.e., the
oxidation products of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as omega-3 and omega-6) on the
fecal microbiota composition of young adults [1], which can have important implications
for metabolic health [2]. Using a mouse model subjected to castration to accelerate sarcope-
nia features (e.g., loss of muscle mass and function), Martins et al.  provide preliminary
evidence on the effects that some phytoanabolic extracts obtained from Eurasian plants
can have, particularly in combination with resistance training, on different indicators such
as body composition, physical function, skeletal muscle/adipose tissue histology, and
other biochemical indicators (e.g., cytokines, blood cholesterol) [3]. Moreover, Bellini et al.
assessed the effect of postprandial walking on glycemic responses in healthy adults, finding
that a 30-min postprandial brisk walking session improved the glycemic response after
meals with different carbohydrate content and macronutrient composition [4]. The findings
by Bellini et al. might be of clinical relevance, particularly given the potential detrimental
effect of postpandrial hyperglycemia for cardiometabolic health [5]. Finally, a review article
by Morales et al. summarizes the role of not only nutrition but also other components of
the so-called “exposome” (e.g., physical activity, body weight, smoking status, sleep habits)
on immune health, which is a timely topic particularly if considering situations such as the
recent COVID-19 pandemic [6].
On the other hand, in this Special Issue, we find other studies more related to ad-
vances in the context of sports. Martinez-Rodriguez et al. report the body composition and
anthropometric characteristics of 36 male players of the Spanish National Beach Handball
Team, a sport that has received little attention to date in scientific research [7]. Focusing on
the field of sports supplements and using a meta-analytical approach (18 studies included),
Gomez-Bruton et al. report that acute caffeine supplementation improves team sport per-
formance in female athletes, as reflected by increases in different outcomes such as specific
team-sport skills as well as on countermovement jump height or total body impacts [8].
Additionally, focused on the field of sports supplements, Su et al. explored the effects of
different doses of resveratrol on performance during a downhill running test to exhaustion
(which was designed to provoke high levels of exercise-induced muscle damage) as well
as on different markers of inflammation and energy metabolism [9]. Of note, high-dose
resveratrol increased the time to exhaustion during the downhill running test and reduced
the levels of pro-inflammatory markers such as tumor necrosis factor-α. It also enhanced
the mRNA expressions of sirtuin 1, glucose transporter 4, AMP-activated protein kinase

α1, and AMP-activated protein kinaseα2[9]. This preliminary evidence suggests, there-
fore, that resveratrol supplementation (in this case, for 4 weeks) might enhance exercise
performance and attenuate inflammation after exercise-induced muscle damage.  In the
same line, Tanabe et al. also review the role of different dietary supplements with potential
anti-inflammatory or antioxidant effects (e.g., curcumin, tart cherry juice, beetroot juice,
quercetin, and isothiocyanate) for attenuating exercise-induced muscle damage and the as-
sociated delayed-onset muscle soreness, highlighting the potential beneficial effect of some
of them but also the need for well-controlled studies [10]. It seems, therefore, reasonable
that many athletes consume supplements with the aim of improving their performance, as
summarized in the scoping review by Daher et al., who also highlight the need for rigorous
research in this field (e.g., trying to homogenize factors such as the definition of dietary
supplements or the definition of use) [11]. This is indeed the topic of the study by Moreno
et al., who analyzed a sample of 102 male and female competitive swimmers and concluded
that 86.9% of them had consumed sports supplements, with caffeine, sports drinks/bars,
and vitamin C being among the most widely consumed and with no differences between
genders or performance level [12].
Great advances are being made in the field of nutrition, which can lead to improve-
ments in both the general health of the population and the performance of athletes. More
high-quality evidence is needed on all the topics mentioned above, but hopefully these and
other studies will lead the way and open new fields of research.

Abstract:
Pre-clinical studies suggest that circulating oxylipins, i.e., the oxidation products of polyun-
saturated fatty acids (PUFAs), modulate gut microbiota composition in mice, but there is no informa-
tion available in humans. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between omega-3
and omega-6 derived oxylipins plasma levels and fecal microbiota composition in a cohort of young
adults. 80 young adults (74% women; 21.9±2.2 years old) were included in this cross-sectional study.
Plasma levels of oxylipins were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
Fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by V3-V4 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We observed that
plasma levels of omega-3 derived oxylipins were positively associated with the relative abundance of
Clostridium cluster IVgenus (Firmicutesphylum; rho≥0.415,p≤0.009) and negatively associated
with the relative abundance ofSutterellagenus (Proteobacteria phylum; rho
≥−0.270,p≤0.041),
respectively.  Moreover, plasma levels of omega-6 derived oxylipins were negatively associated
with the relative abundance ofAcidaminococcusandPhascolarctobacteriumgenera (Firmicutesphylum;
all rho≥−0.263,p≤0.024), as well asSutterella,Succinivibrio, andGemmigergenera (Proteobacteria
phylum; all rho≥−0.263,p≤0.024). Lastly, the ratio between omega-6 and omega-3 oxylipins plasma
levels was negatively associated with the relative abundance ofClostridiumcluster IV genus (Firmi-
cutesphylum; rho =−0.334,p= 0.004) andButyricimonasgenus (Bacteroidetesphylum; rho =−0.292,
p= 0.014). In conclusion, our results show that the plasma levels of omega-3 and omega-6 derived
oxylipins are associated with the relative abundance of specific fecal bacteria genera.

1. Introduction
Chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, usually ac-
company low-grade chronic inflammation [1–3]. The rising prevalence of such diseases is
believed to be driven by an unbalanced diet, which is often characterized by a low intake
of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and a high intake of omega-6 PUFAs [4,5].
Omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs can be oxidized into oxylipins by lipoxygenases (LOXs),
cyclooxygenases (COXs), and the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) family enzymes [6,7]. Oxylip-
ins are the primary mediators of the PUFA-related effects through their binding to G protein-
coupled receptors (GPCRs) or peroxisome proliferator-activate receptors (PPARs) [6,7].
Generally, omega-3 derived oxylipins exert anti-inflammatory and pro-resolutive actions
since both eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) decrease the
synthesis of pro-inflammatory mediators and increase the production of anti-inflammatory
mediators (e.g., prostaglandins of the three series, leukotrienes of the five series, resolvins,
protectins and maresins) [8,9]. In contrast, omega-6 derived oxylipins typically increase
inflammation by acting as pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g., prostaglandins of the two
series and leukotrienes of the four series) [9,10].
The gut microbiota is composed of microorganisms that colonize the gastrointestinal
tract, where bacteria are the most abundant [11]. In humans, the gut microbiota is mainly
composed of five phyla:  Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and
Verrucomicrobia [
12,13].  The gut microbiota is involved in the maintenance of the gut
barrier permeability [14,15] and regulation of the intestinal inflammatory status through
specific bacteria, their interaction with intestinal cell receptors and their secreted metabolites
(e.g., short chain fatty acids) [16,17]. Interestingly, the composition of gut microbiota and
metabolite production can be modified by dietary intake (e.g., nitrogenous compounds,
carbohydrates, fatty acids, fiber) [
18].  The specific dietary intake of PUFAs, concretely
omega-3 PUFAs, increasesBacteroidetes:Firmicutesratio and the diversity and counts of
commensal bacteria (i.e.,Akkermansia muciniphila,LactobacillusandBifidobacterium)[
19].
In this sense, dietary patterns with a high content of omega-3 and a low content of omega-6
PUFAs (e.g., Mediterranean Diet) could have a positive influence on the health status
of humans via the modulation of the gut microbiota partially due to the positive effects
of these PUFAs in the intestinal immunity [
19,20].  Therefore, studying the relationship
between the primary mediators of PUFAs effects (e.g.,  oxylipins) with gut microbiota
composition is of clinical interest.
A recent study showed that FAT-1 transgenic mice, which can convert omega-6 to
omega-3 PUFAs, had a higher relative abundance of Firmicutes, Bacteroides, and Acti-
nobacteria phyla in comparison to wild-type (WT) mice [
21].  On the other hand, FAT-2
transgenic mice, which can transform monounsaturated fatty acids into omega-6 PUFAs,
showed a distinct gut microbiota composition compared to FAT-1 mice [21]. Specifically,
FAT-2 mice were characterized by a depletion of theBifidobacteriaceaefamily (Actinobacteria
phylum) vs. WT mice [22]. This study demonstrated that omega-6 and omega-3 PUFAs
levels influence gut microbiota composition and their secreted metabolites, influencing
intestinal permeability, reducing the inflammatory status and ultimately affecting the risk
of chronic disease [22]. In addition, gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by a typical cafeteria
diet altered the plasma profile of oxylipins in obese rats [23]. We, therefore, hypothesize
that plasma levels of omega-3 and omega-6 derived oxylipins are associated with gut
microbiota composition.  In the present study, we investigated the association between
omega-3 and omega-6 derived oxylipins plasma levels and fecal microbiota composition in
young adults.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants
The participants were part of the ACTIBATE study [24], an exercise-based randomized
controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02365129) designed to evaluate the effect of
exercise training on brown adipose tissue activity. Participants were recruited via advertise-
ments in electronic media and leaflets. All participants reported being sedentary (less than
20 min of moderate/vigorous physical activity on less than three days per week) and had
a stable body weight over the preceding three months (<3 kg change). The exclusion criteria
were being pregnant, smoking, taking any medication, including antibiotics, and having
an acute or chronic disease. The study protocol was designed following the Declaration of
Helsinki. All participants gave their informed consent and were approved by the Ethics
Committee on Human Research of the University of Granada (n
◦
.924) and Servicio Andaluz
de Salud (Centro de Granada, CEI-Granada).
In the present study, only participants with baseline data for plasma oxylipins and
fecal microbiota composition available were included (80 young adults;n= 59 women;
21.9±2.2 years old).
2.2. Determination of Plasma Levels of Oxylipins
Blood samples were collected between 8:00–9:00 AM after 10 h overnight fasting.
All blood samples were immediately centrifuged to obtain plasma aliquots (obtained
with Vacutainer
®
Hemogard™tubes, containing the potassium salt of ethylenediaminete-
traacetic acid as an anticoagulant) and stored at−80
◦
C. Plasma levels of omega-3 and
omega-6 oxylipins were measured with a targeted metabolomics approach using liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), with a method validated ac-
cording to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) bioanalytical method validation
guidelines [25].
With this targeted LC-MS/MS approach, the relative quantification of oxylipins de-
rived from the conversion of the omega-3 PUFAsα-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic
acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA); as well as omega-6 PUFAs linoleic acid (LA),
dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA), arachidonic acid (AA), and adrenic acid (AdrA) was
performed.  The oxylipins detected by this method and the internal standards used are
listed in Table S1. The ratio between the peak area of each oxylipin and the peak area of
its respective internal standard was used for the relative quantitation. All the data from
omega-3 derived oxylipin species were summed; the same was performed for omega-6
derived oxylipins (Table S2). Additionally, the plasma omega-6/omega-3 oxylipins ratio
was calculated by dividing the sum of plasma omega-6 derived oxylipins peak area ratio
by the sum of plasma omega-3 derived oxylipins peak area ratio.  The methodology is
described in detail in the supplementary material.
2.3. Fecal Collection and DNA Extraction
Fecal samples were stored in a 60-mL sterile plastic container, transported in a portable
cooler to the research center and stored at−80
◦
C until DNA extraction. DNA extraction
and purification were performed with a QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Barcelona,
Spain), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  Concentration and quality were
determined with a NanoDrop ND1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, DE,
Waltham, Massachusetts, USA).
DNA was amplified by PCR targeting the V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of the
bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The amplicons were sequenced in a MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego,
CA, USA), using the Illumina MiSeq paired-end sequencing system (2×300 nt) (Illumina,
San Diego, CA, USA). We used the “dada2” package version 1.10.1 in R software [26] for
merging and filtering raw sequences (FastQ files). Ribosomal Data Project (RDP) [27] was
used to assign the phylotypes to their specific taxonomic affiliation (from phylum to genus).
The methodology is described in detail in the supplementary material.

The SECA model 799 electronic column scale and stadiometer (SECA, Hamburg,
Germany) were used to measure the height and weight of study participants wearing stan-
dard clothes without shoes. A dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan (Hologic Discovery
Wi Marlborough, MA) was used to measure body composition, i.e., lean and fat mass.
The body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight/height
2
.
2.5. Dietary Assessment
The dietary assessment is explained in detail elsewhere [28–30].  The EvalFINUT
®
software was used to assess dietary intake (energy and nutrient intake) from three 24 h
dietary recalls [
28–30].  The 24 h dietary recalls were undertaken on three separate days
(i.e., two weekdays and one weekend) during face-to-face interviews by qualified and
trained dietitians. Two dieticians independently introduced the data from all interviews
in the software.  The food frequency consumption was assessed using a food frequency
questionnaire (FFQ) [31], in which participants answered how often they had consumed
each food item over the last three months, using commonly used portion size.
2.6. Statistical Analysis
Sample size estimation and power calculation were based on the primary outcome
of the ACTIBATE study [
24].  The current study is based on a secondary analysis using
its baseline data. Therefore, no specific power calculation or sample size estimation was
developed for the present study.
The descriptive parameters are presented as mean and standard deviation.  First,
data normality was checked using the D’Agostino & Pearson test. Due to the non-normal
distribution of plasma levels of oxylipins and parameters of fecal microbiota composition,
all analyses were conducted using non-parametric tests.
To investigate the relationship between the sum of omega-3 and omega-6 derived oxylip-
ins and the omega-6/omega-3 oxylipin ratio with fecal microbiota composition at phylum and
genus taxonomy levels, we employed Spearman correlation analysis by using “psych” and
“corrplot” packages in R software. Volcano plots were used to depict these correlations using
GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA, version 8.0.0). Then,
to examine the relationship between plasma levels of each omega-3 and omega-6 oxylipin
and specific bacterial microbiota, we used Spearman correlation analysis, using “psych” and
“corrplot” in R software. Heatmap plots were used to represent these correlations using the
“Gplot” package in R software. Lastly, partial Spearman correlations were adjusted for BMI,
total PUFAs, and fish intake. The level of significance was set atp< 0.05.

3.2. The Plasma Levels of Omega-3 Oxylipins Are Associated with the Relative Abundance of
Clostridium Cluster IV and Sutterella Genera
At the phylum level, we found no association between the sum of plasma levels of
omega-3 oxylipins with fecal microbiota composition (allp> 0.05; Figure1A–D). However,
at the genus level, the total plasma levels of both omega-3 and DHA-derived oxylipins
(Table S3) were positively associated with the relative abundance ofClostridium cluster IV
(Firmicutesphylum; rho≥0.415,p≤0.009; Figure1E,H). Moreover, the total plasma levels
of omega-3, ALA-, EPA-, and DHA-derived oxylipins were negatively associated with the
relative abundance of theSutterellagenus (Proteobacteriaphylum; rho≥−0.270,p≤0.041;

The plasma levels of the individual omega-3 oxylipins DPA, DHA, 8-HDoHE,13-HDoHE
and 19,20-DiDHPA, were positively associated with the relative abundance ofClostridium
cluster IVgenus (all rho≥0.314,p≤0.018; Figure S1A). Conversely, the plasma levels of ALA,
EPA, 5-HEPE, DHA, 4-HDoHE and 19,20-DiDHPA were negatively associated with the relative
abundance of theSutterellagenus (all rho
≥−0.338,p≤0.042; Figure S1B). These associations
remained significant after adjusting for BMI, PUFAs, and fish intake (Tables S3 and S4).

3.3. The Plasma Levels of Omega-6 Oxylipins Are Negatively Associated with the Relative
Abundance of Genera Belonging to Firmicutes and Proteobacteria Phyla
At the phylum level, the total plasma levels of omega-6, LA- and DGLA-derived oxylipins
were  negatively  associated  with  the  relative  abundances  ofBacteroidetes(allrho≥−0.274,
p
≤0.040;  Figure2A–C), whereas the total plasma levels of AdrA-derived oxylipins were
negatively associated with the relative abundance ofProteobacteria(
rho =−0.284,p= 0.013;
Figure2E). However, the total plasma levels of LA-derived oxylipins were positively associated
with the relative abundance ofVerrucomicrobiaphylum (rho = 0.255,p= 0.022; Figure2B). At
the genus level, we found that the total plasma levels of omega-6, LA-, and DGLA-derived
oxylipins were negatively associated with the relative abundance of Acidaminococcus and
Phascolarctobacteriumgenera (Firmicutesphylum; all rho≥−0.326,p≤0.034; Figure2F–H). We
also observed that the total plasma levels of omega-6, DGLA-, AA-, and AdrA-derived oxylipins
levels were negatively associated with the relative abundance ofSutterella,Succinivibrio, and
Gemmigergenera (Proteobacteriaphylum; all rho
≥−0.258,p≤0.042; Figure2F–J). Similarly,
the total plasma levels of DGLA-derived oxylipins were negatively associated with the relative
abundance of theOdoribactergenus (Bacteroidetesphylum; rho =−0.246,p= 0.028; Figure2H).

adjusting for BMI, PUFA, and fish intake (Tables S3 and S4).
3.4. The Plasma Omega-6/Omega-3 Oxylipin Ratio Is Negatively Associated with the Relative
Abundance of Clostridium Cluster IV and Butyricimonas Genera
At the phylum level, we found no associations between the omega-6/omega-3 oxylipin
ratio in plasma and fecal microbiota composition (allp> 0.05; Figure3A). On the other
hand, at the genus level, the omega-6/omega-3 oxylipin ratio was negatively associated
with the relative abundance ofClostridium cluster IV(Firmicutesphylum; rho =

4. Discussion
In the present study, we show that plasma levels of oxylipins are linked to the fecal
microbiota composition of young adults. Specifically, plasma levels of omega-3 derived
oxylipins were positively associated with the relative abundance ofClostridiumcluster IV
and negatively associated with the relative abundance ofSutterellagenera. Additionally,
plasma levels of omega-6 derived oxylipins were negatively associated with the relative
abundance of several genera.   In contrast,  the ratio of omega-6/omega-3 oxylipins in
plasma was negatively associated with the relative abundance ofClostridiumcluster IV and
Butyricimonasgenera. These findings suggest that the plasma levels of omega-3 and omega-
6 derived oxylipins may modulate the relative abundance of gut microbiota composition,
or vice versa, in young adults.
We found that the plasma levels of omega-3 derived oxylipins and the omega-6/omega-
3 oxylipin ratio in plasma are positively and negatively associated, respectively, with the
relative abundance ofClostridiumcluster IV genus,  which is composed ofClostridium,
Eubacterium,Ruminococcus, andAnaerofilumgenera. Similarly, theFAT-1mice, capable of
transforming omega-6 into omega-3 PUFAs, also showed a higher relative abundance of
Clostridiumcluster IV genus compared to WT mice [21]. TheClostridiumcluster IV genus
bacteria have been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects and maintain intestinal health
via the production of short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrate [32]. These findings suggest
that higher plasma levels of omega-3 derived oxylipins could improve systemic and in-
testinal health through an increased relative abundance ofClostridiumcluster IV genus,
which produces butyrate and ultimately enhances intestinal barrier function and immu-
nity [
33].   In contrast,  gut microbiota influences the production of omega-6 oxylipins,
conferring host resistance to high-fat diet-induced obesity and adipose tissue inflammation
in mice [34]. The above-mentioned pre-clinical studies are confirmed in the present human
cohort, reinforcing the clinical benefits of omega-3 PUFAs, specifically its oxylipins, on
human health.
Additionally, we identified that plasma levels of omega-3 and omega-6 oxylipins
are negatively associated with the relative abundance of theSutterellagenus in feces. In
line with these results, rats consuming a diet rich in the omega-6 PUFA LA for 10 weeks
10

Nutrients2022,14, 4991
showed a decrease in the relative abundance of theSutterellagenus [35].   In contrast,
daily oral supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs (i.e., 4 g of EPA and DHA) for eight
weeks increased the relative abundance ofSutterellaceaefamily in feces of in middle-aged
healthy humans [36]. After a wash-out period of eight weeks, the relative abundance of the
Sutterellaceaefamily returned to baseline levels [
36]. These studies show that supplementing
omega-3 or omega-6 PUFAs can modulate the relative abundance of the specific bacteria in
the gut. This effect might be explained by the direct effects of dietary PUFAs in the intestine
since PUFAs and their downstream oxylipins can modify the fatty acid composition of the
intestinal brush border membrane, increasing the intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP)
activity in the small intestine [37,38]. Thus, we hypothesize that oxylipins could modulate
IAP activity similarly to their PUFA precursors.  In this regard, both supplementation
of omega-3 PUFAs [
21] and overproduction of omega-6 PUFAs [39] have been shown to
induce the release of IAP from enterocytes, either through the modulation of resolvins
(i.e., distal mediators of the anti-inflammatory/pro-resolution cascade derived from omega-
3 oxylipins) [40] or the increase in the relative abundance of certain bacteria (e.g.,Sutterella
genus [22] that can produce lipopolysaccharides [LPS]). IAP dephosphorylates LPS [41],
preventing LPS from binding to Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) [41], consequently avoiding the
activation of the inflammatory cascade [41]. Since gut microbiota could contribute to the
levels of oxylipins in response to inflammation [23], we hypothesize that plasma oxylipins
could translocate to the gut lumen, as with other inflammatory mediators. Therefore, the
relationship observed between omega-3 and omega-6 oxylipins plasma levels and the
relative abundance of theSutterellagenus could be partially explained by the modulation
of IAP activity in humans.  Although this hypothesis is based on pre-clinical studies, it
should be explored in future studies specifically designed. However, our results describe
the relationship between the omega-3 and omega-6 oxylipins with these specific bacteria for
the first time in humans. Since oxylipins are the primary mediators of PUFAs physiological
effects, mainly in regulating the inflammatory and immune response, our results are of
great clinical interest.
Limitations and Strengths
This study shows the following limitations:  the cross-sectional study design does
not allow to establishment a cause-effect relationship. Our results should be interpreted
with caution due to the lack of specific sample size and power calculation for the current
study. The analyses were not controlled for false discovery rate (FDR) since this approach
is hypothesis-generating, and adjusting for FDR might overcorrect potentially meaningful
findings. Lastly, while these results generate new hypotheses, further research is needed
to elucidate the direction of the crosstalk between plasma levels of oxylipins and fecal
microbiota since plasma oxylipins might influence fecal microbiota composition and vice
versa. On the other hand, two major strengths in this study are: (i) we performed DNA
sequencing with one of the latest technologies (Illuminaplatform) and using the DADA2
program that uses amplicon sequence variants instead of operational taxonomic units [42];
and (ii) RDP conducted the annotation step until the genus taxon, a methodology with
an annotation error less than 10% [43].
5. Conclusions
Our study reveals that plasma omega-3 oxylipins are positively associated with the
relative abundance ofClostridium clusterIV genus. In contrast, plasma levels of omega-3 and
omega-6 oxylipins are negatively associated with the relative abundance of theSutterella
genus in fecal samples of young adults.  These results may suggest that plasma levels
of omega-3 and omega-6 oxylipins modulate human gut microbiota composition. Based
on the well-known influence of omega-3 and omega-6 oxylipins on human health, our
results suggest that these oxylipins may be involved in regulating the gut barrier function
in humans. However, future studies should address the influence of omega-3 and omega-6

supplementation in gut microbiota health, as well as the effect of different probiotics on the
regulation of oxylipins in the plasma and the gut barrier.

Abstract:Dry extracts from the Eurasian plants,Ajuga turkestanica,Eurycoma longifolia, andUrtica
dioicahave been used as anabolic supplements, despite the limited scientific data on these effects. To
assess their actions on early sarcopenia signs, male and female castrated mice were supplemented
with lyophilized extracts of the three plants, isolated or in association (named TLU), and submitted to
resistance exercise. Ovariectomy (OVX) led to body weight increase and non-high-density cholesterol
(HDL) cholesterol elevation, which had been restored by exercise plusU. dioicaextract, or by exercise
and TLU, respectively.  Orchiectomy (ORX) caused skeletal muscle weight loss, accompanied by
increased adiposity, being the latter parameter reduced by exercise plusE. longifoliaorU. dioica
extracts. General physical activity was improved by exercise plus herbal extracts in either OVX or
ORX animals. Exercise combined with TLU improved resistance to fatigue in OVX animals, though
A. turkestanicaenhanced the grip strength in ORX mice.E. longifoliaor TLU also reduced the ladder
climbing time in ORX mice. Resistance exercise plus herbal extracts partly altered gastrocnemius
fiber size frequencies in OVX or ORX mice.  We provide novel data that tested ergogenic extracts,
when combined with resistance exercise, improved early sarcopenia alterations in castrated male and
female mice.

1. Introduction
Declining of hormonal levels in aging is a predictor factor for the onset of skeletal
muscle loss and related diseases, such as sarcopenia [1–4]. Sarcopenia is characterized by a
progressive reduction in muscle quantity and quality, leading to impaired movement, less-
ened strength, with an increased risk of injuries secondary to falls, being often associated
with frailty [5,6]. Nutritional intervention and physical exercise are valuable alternatives
for prevention and management of sarcopenia [5,7,8]. Various drugs and supplements have
emerged to treat sarcopenia, such as antioxidant supplementation, vitamin D, ursolic acid,
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, melatonin, ghrelin, dehydroepiandrosterone
(DHEA), and selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMS) [9–14]. Current treatments

are focused on hormone replacement therapy, which might display adverse effects includ-
ing exacerbation of sleep apnea, delayed wound healing, gynecomastia, increased volume
of red blood cells, higher risk of cardiovascular diseases and cancer, besides virilization in
women [15,16].
Phytotherapy represents an attractive option to treat several diseases and has been used
for sarcopenia prevention and maintenance of hormonal levels [17,18]. Herbal medicine
involves the use of the plant alone or in combination with other plants that have com-
plementary properties.  The association of selected herbal extracts has been employed
as supplements to increase muscle mass gain, based on their folk use as anabolic agents.
Particularly, dry extracts obtained from the Eurasian plantsAjuga turkestanica,Eurycoma
longifolia, andUrtica dioicahave been used for this end worldwide.  However, there is
limited scientific evidence about their efficacy and safety, and a very few studies have
investigated their effects on sarcopenia.
A. turkestanica,  a plant native from Uzbekistan,  is rich in ecdysteroids,  including
turkesterone and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE). It has been used for its benefits on muscle
strength, muscle pain, and heart protection [19]. A study conducted by Isenmann et al. [20]
investigated the effects of a commercial product containing 100 mg of ecdysteroids on
strength and muscle mass of athletes. As evidenced, there was an increase in muscle mass,
and in the concentration of serum insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1), without changes in the
concentrations of luteinizing hormone, testosterone, or estradiol [20]. Noteworthy, because
of the hormone-related effects, this substance became part of the monitoring program of the
World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in 2020 for professional athletes, inside and outside
competitions [21].
E. longifoliaJack, also known as Malaysian Ginseng or Tongkat Ali, is commonly
found in Southeast Asia. The plant is rich in several classes of bioactive compounds, such
as eurycomanone, eurycomanol, 13α(21)-epoxueurycomanone, and 13α,21-dihydroeury
comanone [22,23]. A standardized extract ofE. longifoliashowed anti-adipogenic effects
in animals [24] and improved several immunological parameters in humans [25]. Clinical
studies have shown favorable results in the prevention of osteopenia in men and post-
menopausal women [
26].  In rats,E. longifolialed to increased serum concentrations of
calcium, phosphate, and alkaline phosphatase, possibly through mechanisms related to
hormonal modulation [27]. The root extract showed positive effects in increasing the sexual
activity in a pre-clinical study [22], and it was able to rise hormone levels in animal [27]
and clinical studies [28]. Though, another clinical study detected no benefit for the extract
supplementation on resistance exercise outcomes [29].
The roots of the Eurasian plantU. dioicaL., popularly known as stinging nettle, has
been used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia, for their anti-inflammatory effects and
binding inhibition of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) to its receptor in prostate
cells [30]. The compounds present inU. dioica extractinclude fatty acids, phenylpropanes,
lignans, coumarins, triterpenes, ceramides, sterols, and lecithins [31,32]. Animals supple-
mented withU. dioicashowed a reduction of adipose tissue accumulation, lower levels
of fasting glucose and insulin, a decrease in HOMA-IR, and a reduction of liver triglyc-
erides [
33].  Compelling pre-clinical evidence revealed a hypoglycemic activity for the
plant, and a meta-analysis carried out by Ziaie and collaborators (2019) corroborated the
beneficial effects ofU. dioicaon glycemic levels. Pre-clinicalin vitroandin vivoevidence
also revealed the ability ofU. dioicato inhibit 5-α-reductase activity, leading to an elevation
of testosterone levels [34].
Considering the abovementioned evidence, the present study aimed to evaluate the
anti-sarcopenic properties ofA. turkestanica,E. longifolia, andU. dioicaextracts, supple-
mented alone or in an association scheme, comparing the possible beneficial actions in
castrated males and females submitted to resistance exercise.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Ethics and Experimental Animals
The experimental protocols used in this study followed the current Brazilian guidelines
for the care and use of animals for scientific and didactic procedures, from the National
Council for the Control of Animal Experimentation (MCTI-CONCEA, Brazil, 2016) [
35],
and  were  approved  by  the  local  Animal  Ethics  Committee  (CEUA/PUCRS  8045/17).
Male  (weighing  18–30  g;  totaln=  200)  and  female  (weighing  18–25  g;  totaln=  221)
12-week-old C57BL/6JUnib specific-pathogen-free mice were obtained from the Center
for Experimental Biological Models (CeMBE/PUCRS). A sample size of 10–12 animals per
group was determined a priori, based on previous publications using castration-related
sarcopenia as the main outcome [
9,36,37]. Exclusion criteria included animals that died
after surgical procedures or gavage,  and replacement was adopted to adjust the final
sample size. The final N per group is indicated in the legend to figures and tables. Male
and female mice were randomly distributed into different experimental cohorts, according
to castration, climbing exercise and treatment with ergogenic plant extracts, as detailed
in  the  next  sections.   A  scheme  showing  the  general  study  design  is  provided  in  the
Supplementary Figure S1.  All over the experimental time, animals were maintained in
microisolator cages (maximum of 5 mice/cage), equipped with inlet/outlet air filters, under
controlled temperature (22
±1
◦
C) and humidity (50–70%), under a light-dark cycle of 12 h
(lights on at 7 a.m., lights off at 7 p.m.).  The cages were covered with autoclaved wood
chip bedding, and mice received standard pelleted chow and filtered water ad libitum.
Behavioral and histological assessments were performed by an operator blinded to the
experimental groups.
2.2. Surgical Castration
All the surgical procedures were performed under general anesthesia, with a mixture
of xylazine (10 mg/kg) and ketamine (100 mg/kg), dosed by intraperitoneal (i.p.) route.
Male and female mice were subjected to bilateral orchiectomy (ORX) or ovariectomy
(OVX), respectively, according to the methodology described beforehand [
9,38]. After a
longitudinal incision in the dorsal skin and musculature, the testicles or the ovaries were
exposed and a ligature was made for homeostasis, before surgically removing the gonads.
The same procedure was carried out in the sham-operated groups (SHAM), but without
ligature placement or organ removal. For pain control, the animals received acetaminophen
(80 mg/kg) by oral route, for 48 h after surgery.  Hereafter, the animal body weigh was
monitored every week until the euthanasia.
Surgical castration was used as rodent models for inducing sarcopenia and sarcopenia-
related functional changes, due to reduced levels of estrogen and testosterone, as it occurs
in menopause and andropause [16,39–42].
2.3. Climbing Exercise Protocol
The resistance training was carried out by using the ladder climbing protocol. The
procedures were initiated 8 weeks after ORX or OVX surgery. Sham-operated or castrated
mice were subjected to a protocol of morning resistance exercise, three times a week, in a
step ladder with 2-mm grids and one-meter height, with an inclination of 85 degrees. For
adaptation, the animals were trained to climb the ladder for three days, one week before.
On the first day, each animal was submitted to two series with three repetitions of climbing.
On days 2 and 3, the training was performed in four series with three repetitions. For eight
weeks, the sections of resistance exercise were performed by placing different weights in
the base of the mouse tail with an adhesive tape. The initial load corresponded to 50% of the
animal body weight, being progressively increased every seven days by 10%. Each section
consisted of four series with 1-min resting, which were repeated three times in intervals
of 2 min. The method was adapted from previous publications [43,44]. Sedentary groups
of sham-operated or castrated mice were adapted in the same environment, but without
any protocol of exercise. For animals submitted to resistance training, the ladder climbing
17

Nutrients2021,13, 1177
time (s) was registered as the mean of three trials, as an additional measure resistance, at
16 weeks after castration (8 weeks after the onset of climbing exercise).
2.4. Treatment with Ergogenic Phytocompounds
Male and female mice from the different experimental groups, castrated or SHAM,
sedentary or submitted to climbing exercise, were randomly distributed into five treatment
groups that received: (i) vehicle (0.9% NaCl solution) 10 mL/kg; (ii)Ajugaturkestanica
lyophilized extract (containing 2.5% of turkesterone) 50 mg/kg; (iii)Eurycoma longifolia
lyophilized extract (containing eurycomanone) 200 mg/kg; (iv)Urtica dioicalyophilized
extract 50 mg/kg (containing 0.82% ofβ-sitosterol); (v) a combination of the three extracts
(named as TLU). The phytoanabolic extracts were administered daily by oral route, for eight
weeks, beginning eight weeks after castration. The doses of the extracts were based on a
series of previous publications showing efficacy and low toxicity in different experimental
paradigms [34,45–59].  A scheme showing the timeline for the experimental protocols
is provided in the Supplementary Figure S2.  Within the figure and table legends, the
following abbreviations have been used: SHAM, sham-operated; OVX, ovariectomized;
ORX, orchiectomized; Exer, exercise (group submitted to exercise protocol); Sed, sedentary
(that have not been submitted to exercise protocol) Turk,Ajuga turkestanica; Long,Eurycoma
longifolia; Urt,Urtica dioica; TLU, the association of the three extracts.
2.5. Determination of Active Principles in Lyophilized Extracts
Samples were individually added in methanol (LiChrosolv, Merck, Darmstadt, Ger-
many)  at  concentration  of  50  mg/mL  and  agitated  in  an  orbital  agitator  Mixer  099A
(Glas-Col, LLC, Terre Haute, IN, USA) at 40 RPM, for 20 min, at room temperature (RT).
Each mixture was incubated in an ultrasound bath T-14 (Thornton, São Paulo, Brazil) for
5 min, at RT and the dissolved phase was used for subsequent determinations.
Total content of phytosterols was determined by spectrophotometry, as previously
described [60], using high-density cholesterol (HDL)-cholesterol (100 mg/L) as reference
standard (Bioclin, Minas Gerais, Brazil) and expressing the results as milligram equivalents
of HDL-cholesterol per gram of lyophilized extract (mgEq/g). Briefly aliquots of each sam-
ple were subsequently evaporated, resuspended in chloroform (Ensure, Merck, Germany),
derivatized with Liebermann–Burchard reagent (LB), and read at 625 nm in a spectropho-
tometer (Spectramax M5, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA), using chloroform as
analytical blank. LB was prepared by mixing 20 mL of ice cooled acetic anhydride (96%,
J.T.Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ, USA) with 2 mL of sulfuric acid (98%, Merck, Germany).
Phytosterols were individually quantified by liquid chromatography with UV detec-
tion (LC-UV), using an Agilent LC system 1260 Infinity (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
CA, USA). Chromatographic separations were performed using a Zorbax Eclipse PLUS
C18 RRHD 2.1×50 mm 1.8-μm column (Agilent, Paolo Alto, CA, USA), with 0.1% formic
acid (eluent A) and 0.1% formic acid in methanol (eluent B) as the mobile phase, in gradient
mode. The gradient was programmed to start with 20% of eluent B. After 2 min, eluent
B was increased to 60%, remaining at this condition for 3 min. For column cleanup step,
eluent B was increased to 100% for 7 min, and changed back to 20% to equilibrate the sys-
tem before the next sample injection. The total time of analysis was 20 min. Ten microliters
of samples were injected into the system, and the column temperature was maintained
at 50
◦
C. The detector was operated simultaneously at 240 and 254 nm. HDL-cholesterol
(Bioclin, Minas Gerais, Brazil) was used as the reference steroid for the calibration curve.
All quantified phytosterols were confirmed by liquid chromatography tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), on an Agilent 6460 Triple Quad mass spectrometer coupled to
Agilent 1290 Infinity chromatograph (Agilent, Paolo Alto, CA, USA). Phytosterol separa-
tions were performed by a similar chromatographic method as used for LC-UV analysis
injecting; however, only five microliters of sample were used due to the method sensitivity.
Analytes were ionized in an electrospray ionization (ESI) source and analyzed in multiple
reaction monitoring mode. The ESI source was operated in positive ion mode, at 350
◦

temperature, cone gas flow rate of 11 L/min, desolvation gas flow rate of 10 L/min, and
a capillary volage of 3500V. The transitions (m/z) monitored were: eurycomanone (m/z
393.4 > 237.2 and 393.4 > 355.2);
β-sitosterol (397.0 > 81.0 and 397.0 > 95.0); turkesterone
(m/z497.0 > 443.0 and 497.0 > 461.0).
2.6. Voluntary Locomotor Activity
Considering the motor deficits related to sarcopenia, the overall spontaneous locomo-
tor activity of animals was assessed at 12 and 16 weeks after surgical procedures in the
different experimental groups [61]. For this purpose, an automatic system comprised of an
acrylic box (46×46×36 cm) with infrared sensors was used. The animals were placed
in the center of the arena, with 1 min for habituation and 5 min for locomotor activity
analysis. The total activity time (s), the traveled distance (cm), and the speed (mm/s) were
registered. Movements were monitored on the x, y, and z-axes, which represent the height,
width, and depth, respectively.
2.7. Rota-Rod Performance
The time until to fatigue was evaluated in the rota-rod apparatus, which consisted of
a rod (3-cm in diameter) with five flanges, allowing the simultaneous evaluation of four
mice. Mice were trained in the device 24 h before the experimental session. For training,
the animals were placed in the device at a speed of 9 RPM until 60 s, and the procedure
was repeated three times, with a 15-s interval. For the experimental sessions, mice were
positioned in the equipment at an initial speed of 9 RPM, with an automatic gradual speed
increase every 36 s, until reaching the maximal velocity of 40 RPM. The latency to fall (s)
was registered as the mean of three trials, with a 15-s interval [
62]. The evaluations were
carried out at 12 and 16 weeks after surgical castration.
2.8. Grasping Test
This test was conducted to determine the grip strength of animals in the different
experimental groups, at 12- and 16-weeks post-castration.  After a gentle lifting by the
tail, mice were allowed to grasp a grid positioned on an electronic balance. Animals were
submitted to three trials, with a 15-s interval.  The number (in grams) showed by the
balance was instantly recorded, and a mean was calculated after the three trials to obtain
the individual grasping strength.
2.9. Euthanasia and Sample Collection
One day after behavioral evaluations, mice were euthanized by deep isoflurane inhala-
tion anesthesia. The blood was collected from the abdominal aorta for subsequent analysis.
The following organs were sequentially collected and weighted (in g):  gastrocnemius,
tibialis anterior, soleus, subcutaneous adipose tissues, liver, kidney, bone, and brain.
2.10. Biochemical Analysis
The serum levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density cholesterol (HDL),
non-HDL, aspartate transaminase (TGO) and alanine aminotransferase (TGP) were mea-
sured using commercial kits (Labtest, Lagoa Santa, Brazil).
2.11. Cytokine Determination
The levels of interleukin-1β(IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin-
10 (IL-10) were measured in gastrocnemius muscle samples obtained from the different
experimental groups.   The cytokine levels were assessed by sandwich enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay using DuoSet kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The results are expressed in pg/mL.

2.12. Histological Analysis of Skeletal Muscle and Adipose Tissue
After registering the wet weight, the gastrocnemius and subcutaneous inguinal adi-
pose tissue were processed for histological assessment. Tissues were fixed in 10% formalde-
hyde, during 24 h.  Subsequently, the samples were included in paraffin and sectioned
in 5-
μm slices, for staining with hematoxylin and eosin.  Images were captured using a
Zeiss AxioImager M2 light microscope under 400×magnification (Carl Zeiss, Gottingen,
Germany) and were analyzed using NIH ImageJ 1.36b Software. Adipocyte diameter was
measured by using an automated tool, whereas the muscle fiber cross-sectional areas (CSA)
were measured manually, using the free-hand function, after adjusting the image scale in
μm
2
. The frequency size distribution of muscle or adipocyte areas were also determined.
For histological analysis, 5–7 slides were evaluated from each group, in a blinded manner.
2.13. Statistical Analysis
Results are provided as the mean±SEM. For time-course data, the areas under the
curve (AUC) were calculated before statistical comparisons. The Shapiro–Wilk test was
used to check data normality.  Statistical analysis was performed by One-way ANOVA

3. Results
3.1. Analysis of Bioactive Compounds in Lyophilized Extracts
The analysis ofA. turkestanicaextract indicated a content of 7.8% regarding the total
phytosterols (78.0 mgEq/g), containing 0.501 mg of turkesterone per gram, as determined
by LC-UV (Figure1C), and confirmed by LC-MS (Figure1D). As forE. longifoliaJack,
the extract presented 0.5% of total phytosterols (5.0 mgEq/g), with 0.009 mg of euryco-
manone per gram (Figure1E,F). The lyophilized extract ofU. dioicapresented 2.8% of
total phytosterols (28.0 mgEq/g), which corresponded to 0.016 mg ofβ-sitosterol per gram
(Figure1G,H). HDL-cholesterol was used to determine total content of phytosterols by VIS
and to estimate the concentration of each phytosterol by LC-UV (Figure1A,B).
3.2. Castration Effects Prior to Exercise and Treatments
OVX resulted in a significant increase of body weight gain in comparison with the
corresponding SHAM females, after seven weeks of surgery (Figure2B). Differently, ORX
led to body weight loss, compared with SHAM males (Figure2D), as evaluated at the
seventh week post-castration. Animals were distributed into sedentary or climbing exercise
groups, and additional experimental treatment subgroups were created avoiding any sig-
nificant differences when comparing the mean body weights, for either females (Figure2B)
or males (Figure2D). Castration was confirmed by a marked reduction of uterus weight
in females (Figure2A) and the absence of testes in males (Figure2C), as evidenced at the
moment of euthanasia (16 weeks).

p< 0.05 significantly different compared
to the sham-operated group (One-way ANOVA followed by Sidak post hoc test).
3.3. Changes in Body Weight after Exercise and Treatments
The body weight was monitored weekly from the time of castration until euthanasia, at
16 weeks. Time-related body weight variations over the weeks are depicted in
Figure3A,D,
for females and males, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC), from 8 to 16 weeks,
was calculated to assess the effects of climbing exercise and ergogenic extracts in SHAM and
castrated groups. OVX triggered a significant increase of AUC in saline-treated sedentary
female mice,  whereas the climbing exercise was able to significantly reduce the body
weight gain in OVX animals, reaching similar levels as seen in SHAM sedentary animals,
irrespective of treatment with the extracts. The exercise also led to diminished body weight
gain in SHAM groups, although significant differences were not observed (Figure3B).
Alternatively, the resistance exercise significantly reduced the final body weight of saline-
treated SHAM females, an effect that was mirrored in the exercise groups treated with
A. turkestanicaextract or TLU. Regarding the OVX animals, only the combination of exercise
andU. dioicaextract significantly reduced the final body weight (Figure3C).

SHAM male mice submitted to climbing exercise displayed a decrease of AUC body
weight gain,  independent on the supplementation with any extracts.   ORX sedentary
males presented a marked loss of body weight gain,  without any beneficial effect for
resistance exercise in saline-treated animals. The treatment of sedentary ORX mice with
the three extracts, alone or in combination, partially reversed the body weight loss induced
by castration.  The combination of ergogenic extracts with exercise failed to recover the
body weight loss in ORX mice (Figure3E). Sedentary ORX animals showed a significant
reduction of final body weight, when compared with sedentary saline-treated SHAM males.
Either exercise or ergogenic extracts failed to recover this parameter (Figure3F). The mean
values for initial, final, and final minus initial body weight for the different experimental
groups are presented in Tables1and2, for females and males, respectively.
3.4. Combined Effects of Ergogenic Extracts and Exercise on Skeletal Muscle Weight
The skeletal muscle weight is an essential marker for defining muscle quantity. As
indicated in Table1, OVX did not evoke any significant alteration of gastrocnemius, tibial
or soleus muscle wet weights, even when the summed weights of the three muscles were
considered, in relation to the corresponding SHAM controls. For females, the treatment of
sedentary OVX mice withA. turkestanicaextract induced a significant reduction of summed
wet weight of gastrocnemius, tibial and soleus, when compared with the respective saline-
treated sedentary OVX group.  The correction of muscle weight per body weight (in %)
did not show any significant differences among the groups. Climbing exercise or supple-
mentation with extracts failed to alter the wet weight of skeletal muscles in SHAM females
(Table1).
In males, castration significantly reduced the wet weight of the gastrocnemius, tibial
and soleus muscles, which was confirmed when the total weight of the three muscles
was determined. Nor exercise or the extracts significantly changed skeletal muscle mass
in SHAM or ORX mice.  As for the correction of muscle weight per body weight (in %),
the association of climbing exercise withU. dioicaextract increased this parameter in a
significant manner (Table2).
3.5. Adipose Depots and the Effects of Exercise and Ergogenic Extracts
In this study, the inguinal fat depots (iWAT) were evaluated as an indicative of white
adipose tissue contents, whilst the interscapular fat (iBAT) was used to assess the presence
of brown adipose tissue. In females, the wet weight of iWAT and iBAT, even after correction
per body weight (in %), did not show any significant differences when comparing SHAM
and OVX mice, regardless of exercise or administration of extracts (Table1). As well, males
did not exhibit any significant differences of iBAT (absolute weight or corrected values),
when the effects of castration, resistance exercise or ergogenic extracts were evaluated
(Table2). Of note, ORX led to a marked increase of iWAT wet weight, when compared with
the corresponding saline-treated SHAM group. This result was confirmed after correction
of iWAT weight per body weight. ORX mice submitted to climbing exercise presented a
trend toward a reduction of iWAT wet weight, but this effect was significant only in the
exercise groups that had been treated withE. longifoliaorU. dioicaextracts. The beneficial
effects of resistance exercise combined withU. dioicaextract were also observed after
analysis of iWAT weight corrected per body weight (in %) (Table2).

3.6. Exercise and Treatment with Phytoanabolic Extracts and Their Effects on
Functional Parameters
Reduced hormone levels and aging-related sarcopenia likely impair muscle strength,
resistance to fatigue and spontaneous locomotor behavior. SHAM females submitted to
climbing exercise and treated withA. turkestanicaextract presented an increase of grip
strength when compared with their sedentary counterparts, according to the evaluation
at 12 weeks (i.e., 4 weeks after intervention onset).  Alternatively, there was a reduction
of grip strength in OVX sedentary mice that had been treated withU. dioica, at the same
experimental time (Figure4A). Neither of the female groups exhibited any significant
difference of grip strength at 16 weeks (Figure4B). At 12 weeks, the protocol of resistance
exercise improved the grip strength of ORX mice in all of the extract-treated groups, except
in the group that receivedU. dioicasupplementation (Figure4C). The treatment with
A. turkestanicaextract improved the grip strength of ORX mice at 16 weeks, regardless of
exercise training (Figure4D).

By using a protocol adapted to assess fatigue resistance in the rotarod apparatus, it was
possible to observe that OVX led to a reduction of resistance to fall in saline-treated seden-
tary mice, an effect that was restored by training exercise, at 12 weeks. However, the effects
of OVX or exercise were not observed for the groups that received any of the ergogenic
extracts, according to the analysis at 12 weeks (Supplementary Figure S3A). At 16 weeks,
the combination of exercise and TLU greatly improved the resistance to fatigue in OVX
animals, whereas the treatment withE. longifoliaplus exercise significantly diminished this
parameter (Supplementary Figure S3B). For males, no significant differences regarding the
resistance to fall in the rotarod equipment were detected at 12 (SupplementaryFigure S3C)
or 16 weeks (Supplementary Figure S3D).
As an additional measurement of resistance, the total time spent for ladder climbing
was measured in the groups submitted to resistance exercise, at 16 weeks (i.e., at the end
of training and treatment protocols). The climbing time did not significantly differ when
comparing SHAM and OVX females, regardless of supplementation with any extracts
(Figure5A). For males, castration significantly increased the total climbing time, and this
effect was prevented by supplementation withE. longifoliaextract or TLU, with partial
effects forA. turkestanicaextract.  Nonetheless, the phytotherapics did not significantly
modify the time to complete the task in SHAM males (Figure5B).

As for the voluntary locomotion, the exercise training led to an overall increase of
travelled distance in SHAM females (Figure6A) and males (Figure6B), according to
the evaluation at 12 weeks.  For OVX mice, the combination of resistance exercise plus
A. turkestanica,orU. dioica, or TLU supplementation, significantly increased the travelled
distance. The climbing exercise failed to significantly alter the travelled distance of saline-
orE. longifolia-treated OVX mice in 12 weeks (Figure6A). In males, resistance exercise
plus supplementation withE. longifolia,orU. dioicaextract enhanced the travelled distance
of ORX animals.  Oppositely, exercise failed to improve the travelled distance in saline-
orA. turkestanica-treated ORX groups, with partial effects for TLU, as seen in 12 weeks
(Figure6D). Females (Figure6C) or males (Figure6F) displayed a time-related reduction
of travelled distance from 12 to 16 weeks, without any significant effects for castration,
exercise, or herbal supplementation at 16 weeks (Figure6B,E).

The analysis of speed in the open-field arena revealed general positive effects for
exercise training in SHAM female (Figure7A) or male mice (Figure7C), as monitored at 12
weeks. In OVX animals, the association of exercise withA. turkestanica,orU. dioica, or TLU
extracts significantly enhanced the speed time of females at 12 weeks (Figure7A). At the
same time-point, ORX males showed an increased speed, in groups that had been submitted
to exercise training plusE. longifolia,orU. dioicaextract (Figure7C). At 16 weeks,  no
significant difference was observed among the experimental groups, for females (Figure7B)
or males (Figure7D).

exercise or herbal supplementation, at 12 or 16 weeks, for females (Supplementary Figure
S4A,B) or males (Supplementary Figure S4D,E), respectively. The combination of resistance
exercise plusA. turkestanicaextract significantly increased the activity time of SHAM male

3.7. Skeletal Muscle Alterations after Exercise and Treatment with Anabolic Extracts
Gastrocnemius sections from the different experimental groups were evaluated re-
garding the cross-sectional areas and the fiber size frequency distribution. In females, only
the exercise protocol combined withE. longifoliaextract treatment caused a significant re-
duction of cross-sectional area of gastrocnemius muscle in OVX mice. For the other groups,
no significant differences were observed for this parameter (Figure8A). The experimental
interventions (i.e., exercise and/or herbal extracts) caused significant alterations of the
fiber size frequency distribution.  The fibers with 0–500
μm
2
were significantly higher
in OVX mice submitted to exercise plusE. longifoliaextract treatment, when compared
with the respective sedentary group.  Sedentary OVX mice treated withA. turkestanica
extract, or OVX mice submitted to exercise plusU. dioicaor TLU supplementation showed a
reduction in the amount of fibers with 1500–2000μm
2
, when compared with saline-treated
sedentary OVX animals.  As for the frequency size >3000μm
2
, there was a significant
higher number of fibers in sedentary OVX mice that had been treated withE. longifolia
(Figure8B). Representative histological images of gastrocnemius muscle in different female
groups are shown in Figure9A–T.
In males, there were no significant differences regarding the gastrocnemius cross-
sectional areas, when comparing SHAM and castrated animals, despite exercise or herbal
supplementation (Figure8C). Concerning the fiber size frequency distribution, ORX mice
showed a significantly higher number of fibers with 0 to 500μm
2
. SHAM males that had
been trained for climbing and were treated withE. longifoliaextract showed a significant
increase of fibers with 2500–3000 and >3000μm
2
, in comparison with saline-treated seden-
tary SHAM males (Figure8D). The Figure10provides representative histological images
of gastrocnemius muscle from the 20 experimental groups composed by males.
3.8. Histological Evaluation of Adipose Tissue
To further evaluate the effects of training exercise and ergogenic extracts on adipose
tissue of SHAM and castrated animals, a histological evaluation of iWAT was carried
out. The assessment of average size of adipocytes did not show any significant difference
when SHAM and OVX females were compared, despite a partial reduction of adipocyte
diameter in mice submitted to exercise plus treatments with isolated or combined extracts
(Figure11A). Moreover, no significant differences were observed among the experimental
groups, when the frequency size of adipocyte areas were evaluated separately, in either
SHAM or OVX mice (Figure11B). Representative histological images of all 20 experimental
groups composed by females are depicted in Figure12A–T. For males,  there were no
differences of total adipocyte areas when comparing SHAM with ORX mice, sedentary or
submitted to exercise, that had been treated with saline or herbal extracts (Figure11C). A
comparison of the frequency size of adipocytes from the same experimental groups did not
show any significant difference (Figure11D). Histological images of iWAT of male mice
(SHAM or ORX) are shown in Figure13A–T.

3.9. Evaluation of Changes in Weights of Kidney, Liver, Brain and Bone
The weight of liver and kidneys was assessed as an indicative of possible toxicity of
herbal extracts, or as a consequence of castration or resistance exercise. The training exercise
led to a significant reduction of kidney wet weight, in comparison with saline-treated
sedentary SHAM females. A significant decrease of kidney weight was also observed in
sedentary OVX mice that receivedA. turkestanicaextract, or in OVX mice submitted to
exercise plus treatment with one of the extracts:A. turkestanica,E. longifoliaorU. dioica,
dosed isolated. The liver weight was increased in OVX mice that receivedA. turkestanicaas
supplementation, irrespective of climbing exercise. Brain and femur bone weights were also
assessed, but no significant differences were detected when comparing the different female
experimental groups (Supplementary Table S1). For males, a significant reduction of kidney
and liver weights was observed in saline-treated sedentary ORX mice, when compared
with SHAM-matched controls. A trend for a decrease of liver and kidney wet weights was
seen in every ORX experimental group, independent on the exercise or treatment. As for
femur bones and brain, no significant differences were seen regarding the male groups
(Supplementary Table S2).
3.10. Biochemical and Inflammatory Parameters
In this part of the study, only saline- or TLU-treated animals distributed in the different
experimental groups regarding castration and/or exercise were tested. Castrated females
showed an elevation of total and non-HDL cholesterol serum levels.  These alterations
returned to values seen in saline-treated sedentary SHAM controls, when OVX mice were
submitted to resistance exercise, regardless of treatment with TLU. The supplementation
with TLU displayed a similar effect in sedentary OVX mice, restoring the total and non-
HDL cholesterol levels. The serum levels of triglycerides, TGO or TGP did not significantly
differ among the experimental groups composed by females (Table3).  In males, serum
cholesterol (total, HDL or non-HDL), triglycerides, TGO or TGP did not present significant
differences when comparing SHAM and ORX mice, sedentary or submitted to training
exercise, despite the treatment with phytotherapics (Table4). The pro-inflammatory IL-1β
and TNF or the anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokines were not detected in the gastrocnemius
muscle of any experimental group of females or males (Tables3and4).

4. Discussion
In this study,  we investigated the anabolic effects ofA. turkestanica,E. Longifolia,
andU. dioicaextracts, administered for two months along with a protocol of resistance
exercise, in castrated female and male mice.  Hormonal balance is an important factor
for maintaining homeostasis, and endocrine alterations can lead to disease development.
Indeed, OVX and ORX have been used as rodent models for inducing sarcopenia, due to
reduced levels of estrogen and testosterone, respectively [16,39–42]. In our study, according
to that described previously in the literature,  OVX led to an increase in body weight
gain [
63,64].  Even so,  ORX promoted a reduction in body weight,  accompanied by a
decline in muscle mass and accumulation of subcutaneous fat [
65,66].   Regarding the
tested herbal extracts and the combination of exercise, the main findings show that:  (i)
the supplementation withA. turkestanicaassociated with exercise recovered the locomotor
activity in OVX animals, while in sham females it showed benefits on muscle strength. (ii)
In male ORX animals,A. turkestanicaimproved the muscle strength regardless of exercise,
whereas the association of the extract with exercise reduced the time to ladder climbing.
(iii)E. longifoliaassociated with exercise showed benefits regarding body composition, with
an increase in the frequency of larger muscle fibers and a marked reduction in inguinal
fat in ORX mice.  Additionally, it increased the muscle strength, and the distance and
speed covered, besides a reduction in the time to climb the ladder. (iv) The association of
U. dioicawith exercise reduced the final weight in OVX mice. It also increased the travelled
distance and speed. (v) In ORX animals, the supplementation withU. dioicaassociated with
exercise increased the percentage of muscle mass over total weight, with a reduction in
inguinal adiposity. An increase in locomotor activity was also observed. (vi) TLU combined
with exercise, in OVX animals, increased the voluntary locomotor activity and the time
until fatigue.  Furthermore, there was a reduction in non-HDL cholesterol independent
on exercise.  (vii) Finally, in ORX animals, TLU plus exercise reduced the time to climb
the ladder and increased the muscle strength. Collectively, the present data suggests that
the tested ergogenic extracts, mainly when combined with resistance exercise, improved
sarcopenia alterations associated with hormonal decline, with different profiles in female
and male mice.
The prophylactic or therapeutic benefits of physical activity on sarcopenia has been
widely demonstrated in the literature. Several variables in the exercise protocol can inter-
fere with the desired effect, such as type, time, frequency and intensity [67]. As described
by Beckwée et al. [8], resistance exercise, performed with the use of weights, has positive
39

Nutrients2021,13, 1177
results in the management of sarcopenia and has been widely indicated for sarcopenic
patients [8]. In animal models, the replication of this type of exercise is complex; however,
some studies proposed the use of ladder climbing associated with draping of weights
in the tail, as a good alternative to reproduce resistance exercise in rodents [
67].  Some
studies described hypertrophy of the soleus plantaris extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and
anterior tibialis muscles, considering their high recruitment in the climbing movement [
68].
In our study, the resistance training exercise did not induce muscle hypertrophy in female
or male SHAM mice, according to the evaluation of gastrocnemius, tibial, or soleus mus-
cles.  Corroborating our data, it was demonstrated that ladder climbing exercise led to
hypertrophy of the flexor hallucis longus (FHL), without any effects on gastrocnemius or
soleus muscles [69]. A possible explanation for the absence of hypertrophy is that climb-
ing exercise primarily involves concentric, but not eccentric muscle actions, with slight
or no muscle mass gain [
69,70].  However, the protocol of exercise adopted by us led to
increased travelled distance and speed in either female or male SHAM animals, showing
its effectiveness to improve physical function, despite the absence of hypertrophy.
Considering the body composition of castrated animals, climbing exercise triggered
a reduction of body weight gain in OVX mice, without changes in skeletal muscle or fat
mass. In females, estrogen displays a protective role in muscle integrity and function [40].
The reduction of estrogen levels in OVX mice might preclude the effects of exercise in
promoting muscle mass gain, despite the overall reduction in body weight. Accordingly,
Bunratsami et al. [71] showed a slight reduction of EDL muscle weight in OVX rats, without
any change in gastrocnemius—in this case, only a high dose of estrogen was able to induce
muscle hypertrophy.   The authors also showed that OVX led to a downregulation of
ER-
αand ER-βreceptors in skeletal muscles [71], reinforcing the relevance of estrogen-
related pathways for muscle mass gain.  As for ORX males, we observed that climbing
exercise potentiated the body weight decrease elicited by castration, partly by diminishing
the accumulation of iWAT, without any effects on skeletal muscle weights.  It has been
suggested that low levels of testosterone might be associated with anabolic resistance in
aged mice, impacting the muscle responsiveness to exercise, regardless of the benefits on
physical function [72]. In OVX and ORX, the resistance exercise also led to improvements of
functional parameters, such as muscle strength, resistance to fatigue and physical activity
as seen in SHAM animals, but in this case when combined with the tested anabolic extracts.
These details will be discussed for each of the three extracts in separated sections.
As a first approach, we decided to analyze the contents of the active compounds in
the lyophilized extracts used in the present study. The presence of ecdysteroids, such as
turkesterone andβ-sitosterol, as well as eurycomanone and other quassinoids in herbal
extracts, have been analyzed by using methanol for sample extraction, as it was used in
the present study [
73–76].  The initial screening was performed spectrophotometrically,
and the identification of active compounds was carried out by LC-MS, and quantified by
LC-UV [77], using HDL-cholesterol as standard [78]. The presence of turkesterone (m/z
497.0 > 443.0 andm/z497.0 > 461.0), eurycomanone (m/z391.5 > 251.1 and 391.5 > 279.1),
andβ-sitosterol (m/z397.0 > 81.0 and 397.0 > 95.0) was confirmed by mass spectrometry,
in lyophilized extracts ofA. turkestanica,E. longifolia, andU. dioica, respectively, based on
transitions previously described in literature [79–81]. Therefore, the lyophilized extracts
used in our study contained the corresponding active compounds as described by the
commercial supplier.
High doses of the ecdysteroid 20-HE were able to increase the muscle mass and to
diminish fat depots in OVX rats, with beneficial effects on lipid metabolism [
82]. In our
study, the supplementation withA. turkestanicain sedentary OVX mice led to reduction
of gastrocnemius weight, with an increased frequency of fibers with a small diameter,
contrasting somewhat with literature data. However, hormone therapy in women is not
likely related to an improvement in muscle mass, despite an increase in muscle strength
after estrogen replacement [83,84].  In fact, in the present study, the administration of
A. turkestanicapotentiated the effects of exercise on physical activity in OVX mice,  as
40

Nutrients2021,13, 1177
indicated by a recovery of travelled distance and speed, what might suggest estrogen-
related actions for this extract on muscle function. Our suggestion is reinforced by data
showing benefits forA. turkestanicaextract in SHAM females submitted to training exercise,
regarding an increase of grip strength.
About the effects of ecdysteroids in males, it was demonstrated that ecdysterone
triggers  muscle  hypertrophy  via  the  activation  of  ER-
β,  without  any  involvement  of
androgen receptors [85]. Strikingly, estrogen supplementation was demonstrated to revert
disuse-related muscle dystrophy in male rodents [86].  In addition, some of the effects
previously attributed to testosterone have been currently linked to estrogens, and there is a
positive correlation between estrogen levels and muscle strength preservation in men [87].
In our study, the treatment withA. turkestanicaextract significantly improved the grip
strength of ORX mice, independent on training exercise.  Moreover, in ORX mice, the
supplementation withA. turkestanicaextract partially restored the time to perform the
ladder climbing task, despite the absence of any effect on wet weight of gastrocnemius,
tibial or soleus.  From this series of results, it is possible to suggest thatA. turkestanica
extract plus resistance exercise differently impacted the muscle function of OVX and ORX
mice, mostly favoring increased physical activity in castrated females, whereas it improved
muscle strength and force in ORX males.
The effects of standardized extract ofE. longifoliahave been studied in animals and
in humans, displaying a positive modulation on testosterone levels [27,28]. In ORX mice,
resistance exercise plusE. longifoliaextract supplementation showed significantly beneficial
effects regarding the body composition, with an increase in the frequency of larger muscle
fibers, and a marked reduction of iWAT. Supporting our data,E. longifoliaextract presented
antiadipogenic actions, via reduction of PPARγand C/EBPαexpression in the early stage
of preadipocyte differentiationin vitro, an effect that was confirmedin vivoin mice [24].
The combination of exercise withE. longifoliasupplementation also improved the functional
performance of ORX mice, by increasing the grip strength and improving travelled distance
and speed, with a marked reduction of time necessary to complete the ladder climbing.
In SHAM males, only travelled distance and speed were improved by this strategy. It is
reasonable to correlate the present findings with the beneficial effects ofE. longifoliaextract
on hypogonadism. Accordingly, the active compounds ofE. longifolia, named eurypeptide
and eurycomanone, were able to modulate the biosynthesis of androgens and to reduce
testosterone degradation by aromatase inhibition, respectively [27,28,54,88].
A previous publication showed that treatment withE. longifoliaherbal extract in-
creased the levels of progesterone and estrogen, with mild effects on bone metabolism
and testosterone levels, according to the evaluation of OVX rats [
27].  In our study, the
supplementation withE. longifoliaextract led to a significant increase of larger muscle fibers
in sedentary OVX mice, whereas it increased the frequency of small fibers in OVX mice
that had been submitted to exercise training.  As for physical aspects,E. longifoliaplus
exercise failed to improve the travelled distance and speed in OVX females and impaired
the resistance to fatigue in the rotarod test.  The divergent effects ofE. longifoliaextract
in castrated males and females might be partly explained by the sex-related differences
concerning the responses of skeletal muscles cells to testosterone, with a higher sensitivity
for males [86].
A  very  few  studies  have  investigated  the  actions  ofU. dioicaextract  in  physical
function,  and as far we know,  there is no previous investigation regarding its effects
in sarcopenia.  Indeed, its main application is related to treatment of benign prostatic
hyperplasia.  In addition, some studies have described benefits forU. dioicaextract for
management of diabetes complications [34,57,89]. More recently, it was demonstrated that
supplementation with plainU. dioicaled to body weight loss in mice that received a high-fat
diet, via modulation of genes related to lipid and glucose metabolism [
33]. In our study, the
association of exercise withU. dioicaextract significantly reduced the final body weight in
OVX mice, and also improved the travelled distance and speed in an open arena. Favorable
effects forU. dioicaplus exercise on physical activity were also observed in SHAM females.
41

Nutrients2021,13, 1177
Conversely, Namjou and collaborators previously described that consumption ofU. dicoica
extract had clear benefits on lipid profile in OVX rats, but not in SHAM controls [90].
In ORX mice, exercise combined withU. dioicawas able to significantly increase the
muscle weight over total body weight, with a reduction of abdominal adiposity, besides an
improvement of locomotor activity. Alternatively, this intervention had minimal effects
in SHAM males. It was demonstrated thatU. dioicaextract had inhibitory effects on 5
α-
reductase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of testosterone in dihydrotestosterone,
increasing the serum testosterone levels, without affecting the prostate weight [34]. The
raise of free testosterone might explain the elevation in muscle percentage in ORX mice,
that had been submitted to exercise plusU. dicoicasupplementation.
It is well known that andropause and menopause can impact several organs [91]. Ad-
ditionally, some plant extracts are known by their toxic effects on these organs [92]. Hence,
the wet weights of kidneys, liver, femur bone and brain were determined in the different
experimental groups of males and females. It was possible to observe thatA. turkestanica
extract reduced kidney weight, while it increased liver mass, according to assessment of
sedentary or trained OVX mice. Noteworthy, protective effects for ecdysteroid compounds
have  been  suggested  before  in  models  of  liver  or  kidney  toxicity  [93].   Indeed,  estro-
gen deficiency has been associated with hepatic steatosis [94], and turkesterone-enriched
A. turkestanicaextract might present favorable effects on this condition. For males, ORX
led to a reduction of liver and kidney mass, without any effects for exercise and herbal
extracts. A previous publication demonstrated that ORX induced a significant decrease of
kidney weight, with a slight reduction of liver mass, in mice receiving a standard chow
diet [95], supporting somewhat the present data. Overall, castration, exercise, and herbal
supplementation had minor effects on organ weights and on most biochemical markers
that had been analyzed, suggesting low toxicity levels.
The association of the three extracts was thought to present complementary mech-
anisms that could generate greater benefits in reversing sarcopenia, as described in folk
medicine.  In our study, TLU, in combination with resistance exercise, significantly in-
creased the voluntary locomotor activity, and improved resistance to fatigue in OVX mice.
Additionally, TLU supplementation recovered the time necessary for ladder climbing and
improved the grip strength in ORX mice.  Nonetheless, TLU failed to alter some of the
tested body composition parameters and physical function, possibly due to the antagonistic
effects of the associated extracts, as discussed beforehand.
To gain further insights into the effects of resistance exercise and TLU in castrated mice,
we analyzed the serum lipids, triglycerides, besides the markers of tissue damage, namely
TGO and TGP. The results did not show any variation of the analyzed biomarkers, except
by an increase of total cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol in saline-treated sedentary
OVX mice. A similar alteration of cholesterol levels has been demonstrated before in OVX
rats [96]. Of note, both climbing exercise and TLU supplementation, implemented alone or
in combination, restored the total and non-HDL cholesterol to the levels seen in SHAM
females counterparts. Based on this result, it is time to infer that exercise combined with
TLU herbal therapy might also be useful for management of cardiovascular alterations in
menopause, besides improving physical performance.
Either inflammatory cytokines, including TNF and IL-1β, or anti-inflammatory cy-
tokines such as IL-10 have been implicated in sarcopenia-related frailty in humans and
rodents [97]. Thus, we investigated whether the experimental interventions tested in the
present study might modulate the levels of these cytokines in gastrocnemius. Any of the
cytokines were undetectable in SHAM, OVX, or ORX groups, irrespective of exercise or
TLU supplementation. It is possible to suggest that gains in physical activity or muscle
strength observed for the combined intervention with exercise plus extracts did not rely on
the modulation of inflammatory markers in skeletal muscle. Further studies are required
to assess other inflammatory markers and different biological matrices.

5. Conclusions
In this study, using castrated mice, we showed that phytoanabolic extracts of the
Eurasian plantsA. turkestanica,E. longifolia, andU. dioica, or TLU, differently modulated
several parameters related to hormone reduction, such as muscle mass, adiposity, muscle
strength, fatigue, general locomotor activity, and lipid profile. These effects were evident
when isolated or associated extracts were supplemented in combination with a training
exercise  protocol.   In  Figure14,  we  provide  a  schematic  illustration  about  the  effects
of the tested interventions on body weight variation and summed weight of skeletal
muscles (gastrocnemius, soleus and tibial). In saline-treated SHAM males and females and
OVX mice, it is possible to observe a trend for reduction in muscle weight, accompanied
by a reduction of body weight gain,  when the animals were submitted to the ladder
climbing exercise. In ORX males, this profile changed, with an inverse effect for exercise on
muscle mass and body weight gain. Concerning the supplementation with herbal extracts,
A. turkestanica,U. dioicaor TLU changed the profile of body weight gain and skeletal muscle
mass in OVX mice.  In ORX mice, all of the tested herbal extracts changed the relation
between the two parameters in comparison with saline treatment. For sham females and
males, there was a change forE. longifoliaorA. turkestanicaextracts, respectively. With this,
it is possible to identify the importance of the association of exercise with the administration
of the extracts considering the management of sarcopenia in menopause and andropause.
Considering the results presented and discussed, we highlight some important points
that we identified in our study.A. turkestanica, combined with exercise, has a different
impact in muscle function of OVX and ORX mice and appears to show better results in
ladder climbing speed and muscle strength in ORX mice compared to OVX mice. When
evaluatingE. longifoliaplus exercise, it is possible to correlate the results with beneficial
effects on hypogonadism. Few studies have investigated the actions ofU. dioicaextract on
physical function and, as far as we know, there is no previous investigation on its effects on
sarcopenia. With presented results we could mention thatU. dioicaassociated with exercise
can have beneficial effects on body composition in castrated males and females. Finally,
when the association of the extracts was carried out, interestingly, we identified that some
of the positive results of the extracts used isolated in the castrated animals were maintained,
while the negative results of some of the extracts were mitigated in the association.

Abstract:We evaluated the effect of postprandial walking on the post-meal glycemic response after
meals with different characteristics.  Twenty-one healthy young volunteers participated in one of
two randomized repeated measures studies. Study 1 (10 participants) assessed the effects of 30 min
of brisk walking after meals with different carbohydrate (CHO) content (0.75 or 1.5 g of CHO per
kg/body weight).  Study 2 (11 participants) evaluated the effects of 30 min of brisk walking after
consuming a mixed meal or a CHO drink matched for absolute CHO content (75 g). Postprandial
brisk walking substantially reduced (p< 0.009) the glucose peak in both studies, with no significant
differences across conditions.  When evaluating the glycemic response throughout the two hours
post-meal, postprandial walking was more effective after consuming a lower CHO content (Study 1),
and similarly effective after a mixed meal or a CHO drink (Study 2), although higher glucose values
were observed when consuming the CHO drink.  Our findings show that a 30 min postprandial
brisk walking session improves the glycemic response after meals with different CHO content and
macronutrient composition, with implications for postprandial exercise prescription in daily life
scenarios.
Keywords:post-meal glycemia; postprandial exercise; breakfast exercise; post-meal exercise
1. Introduction
Elevated postprandial blood glucose concentration and large glycemic excursions
have been identified as better predictors of cardiometabolic disorders than fasting hyper-
glycemia in both healthy individuals and diabetic patients [1]. Indeed, exaggerated blood
glucose spikes lead to a higher increase in oxidative stress [2], endothelial dysfunction [2,3],
proinflammatory factors levels [4], and in the risk of developing cardiovascular patholo-
gies [5] than fasting hyperglycemia.  Exercise and nutrition have a fundamental role in
the management of excessive elevation of post-meal glycemia [
6], and previous studies
have shown that postprandial exercise, also in relation to the modality it is administered,
is effective in improving the glycemic response to a standard meal [6–11]. However, it is
currently unclear if the prescription of postprandial exercise should take into account the
characteristics of the meal and how.
Among the exercise parameters, exercise timing has a key role in improving post-meal
glycemic control [7,8,12,13]. Previous studies have widely demonstrated that exercising
in the period immediately after the meal provides a greater reduction in the post-meal
glycemic peak compared with pre-meal exercise, especially when exercise starts before
reaching peak glucose levels [8,14]. Other parameters have a lower impact on the glucose
response to a meal compared with exercise timing. For instance, the modulation of exercise
intensity and duration does not lead to substantial variations in postprandial glucose
concentration in healthy individuals [
8,15].  Likewise, aerobic, resistance, or combined
exercises are similarly effective in improving the post-meal glycemic response [7,8]. Hence,
moderate-intensity walking appears to be a feasible exercise option for everyone as it can

easily be performed without the need for any equipment and supervision of an exercise
specialist.  Importantly, postprandial walking has been proven effective for improving
glycemic response to different meals of the day (i.e., breakfast, lunch, and dinner) both in
healthy and diabetic individuals [8,11,14,16–19].
Nutrition is another important factor to consider when attempting to improve the
glycemic response to a meal. While the meal characteristics may widely vary in daily life,
the studies assessing the effects of postprandial exercise on glycemia have rarely attempted
to evaluate the effects of exercise after different mixed meals.  A large body of research
focused on the effects of postprandial exercise after the consumption of an oral glucose
tolerance test (OGTT), thus inducing a different glycemic response compared with that of a
mixed meal [
20], which better resembles what is often consumed in daily life. When the use
of a mixed meal was implemented, it was consistently shown that 30 min of step cadence
paced moderate-intensity walking is effective in improving the glycemic response to a meal
providing 1 g of CHO per kg of body weight [8].  However, it is currently unclear how
the effectiveness of a typical postprandial walking session (e.g., 30 min of brisk walking)
would change in relation to meals with different CHO content and composition.
Indeed, among the nutritional factors affecting the glycemic response to a meal, the
amount of carbohydrate (CHO) provided with the meal plays an important role. Previous
studies have documented a higher glycemic response with the increase in the meal CHO
content  [21].   The  macronutrient  characteristics  of  the  meal  may  also  have  a  relevant
influence on the postprandial glucose response.  Indeed, high-protein and/or high-fat
meals induce a significant reduction in the postprandial glucose response [
22–26].   In
addition, whether a meal is solid or liquid should also be considered for the impact on the
postprandial glycemic response, with higher glycemic excursions observed after a liquid
meal compared with a solid one [27,28].
Therefore, we performed two studies aiming to determine the effects of postprandial
walking on the glycemic response to meals with different characteristics. Study 1 evaluated
the effects of exercise after mixed meals with different CHO content, while Study 2 as-
sessed the effects of exercise after the consumption of meals with a different macronutrient
composition (e.g., mixed meal vs. CHO drink (i.e., OGTT)), but the same amount of CHO.
Collectively, findings from the two studies were expected to assess the efficacy of 30 min of
postprandial brisk walking when varying some characteristics of the meal, with potential
implications for implementing this simple exercise strategy in daily life.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants
Twenty-three healthy, physically active (reaching the minimum amount of physical
activity recommended by the World Health Organization guidelines [29]),  young and
healthy adults (20–35 years old) volunteered to participate in this investigation. In total,
twenty-one individuals completed all the experimental protocols of one of the two studies.
More detailed information on participants’ characteristics is reported in Table1. The studies
were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and ethical approval was
provided by the Local Ethical Committee (52/2020, 11 June 2020). Written informed consent
was obtained from all the volunteers involved in the study.

2.2. Study Overview
Volunteers performed one of the two repeated measures studies with four experimen-
tal trials per study. At the beginning of each study, a familiarization visit was performed.
Subsequently, participants performed four experimental visits in a randomized order, last-
ing 2 h each. At least seventy-two hours of rest were considered between visits in order to
avoid any residual effect of exercise [30]. In Study 1, participants consumed a breakfast
differing in CHO content (i.e., 0.75 vs. 1.5 g of CHO per kg of body weight), while in Study
2 participants consumed a breakfast differing in macronutrient composition (i.e., CHO
drink vs. mixed meal) with the same amount of CHO (i.e., 75 g). In each study and meal
condition, after breakfast participants performed 30 min of moderate-intensity walking
or remained seated for the whole experimental period. A schematic representation of the
design of the two studies is shown in Figure1.
Figure 1.Graphic representation of the two studies.  In Study 1, participants consumed a meal
containing 0.75 g of carbohydrates (CHO) per kg of body weight (BW) (0.75CON and 0.75EX), or
1.5 g of CHO per kg of BW (1.5CON and 1.5EX). In Study 2, participants consumed 75 g of CHO
alone dissolved in water (OGTT_CON and OGTT_EX) or 75 g of CHO combined with protein
and fat in a solid mixed meal (MEAL_CON and MEAL_EX). For both studies,  after each meal
participants performed 30 min of walking started 15 min after the beginning of the meal (0.75EX,
1.5EX, OGTT_EX, and MEAL_EX) or remained seated for the whole experimental period (0.75CON,
1.5CON, OGTT_CON, and MEAL_CON). After the 30 min of walking, participants remained seated
until the end of the experimental period.

2.3. Familiarization
Before the beginning of each study, volunteers participated in a familiarization session,
during which all the experimental procedures adopted were explained. Participants were
requested to avoid moderate-to-vigorous physical activity for the 48 h preceding each
experimental visit and to abstain from caffeine and alcohol consumption since the evening
before the visit. Participants were also requested to register activities performed during the
48 h and food consumed during the 24 h before the first experimental visit and to replicate
them before the remaining three visits.
2.4. Study 1—The Effects of Postprandial Exercise on Glycemia after Consuming Mixed Meals
with Different CHO Content
Ten participants were included in this study and completed all the visits (Table1).
Participants attended the laboratory at 08.00 a.m.  after an overnight fasting (>10 h of
fasting).  At 09.00 a.m., participants consumed one of two meals high in CHO content,
containing 0.75 g (0.75CON and 0.75EX) or 1.5 g (1.5CON and 1.5EX) of CHO per kg of
body weight.  The meal consisted of partially skimmed milk, rusks, and jam (Table2).
Participants were given 10 min to finish their meal. After each meal, participants remained
seated until the end of the experimental session (0.75CON and 1.5CON) or performed
30 min of walking starting 15 min after the beginning of the meal (0.75EX and 1.5EX), as
shown in Figure1.

in a mixed meal along with protein and fat. Data are expressed as mean±SD.
2.5. Study 2—The Effects of Postprandial Exercise on Glycemia after Consuming Meals with
Different Macronutrient Composition
Eleven participants were included in this study and completed all the visits (Table1).
As for Study 1, participants attended the laboratory at 08.00 a.m. after an overnight fasting
(>10 h of fasting), and at 09.00 a.m. consumed 75 g of glucose (Yamamoto Nutrition, Italy)
dissolved in 300 mL of water (as commonly done for the OGTT) or a mixed meal, providing
the same amount of CHO. The mixed meal consisted of 280 mL partially skimmed milk,
44  g  rusks,  and  50  g  jam  (MEAL_CON  and  MEAL_EX).  Detailed  information  on  the
macronutrient composition of the two meals is reported in Table2. Participants were given
10 min to finish their meal.  As for Study 1, after the meal, participants remained seated
for the whole experimental period (OGTT_CON and MEAL_CON) or performed 30 min
of exercise starting 15 min after the beginning of the meal (OGTT_EX and MEAL_EX)
(Figure1).
2.6. Exercise and Resting Time
Participants were invited to remain seated throughout all the visits of the two studies,
except for the 30 min of exercise or for using services. While sitting they were allowed to
read or use the PC, but they were asked to replicate their actions during all the visits.
The exercise was the same for the four exercise visits of the two studies (i.e., 0.75EX,
1.5EX, OGTT_EX, and MEAL_EX) (Figure1). Specifically, it consisted of 30 min of walk-
52

Nutrients2022,14, 1080
ing, started 15 min after the beginning of the meal (09.15 a.m.), at 120 steps per minute,
rhythmically established through a digital metronome (Soundbrenner, Berlin, Germany).
Participants walked alone on an indoor track.  The use of step cadence has been previ-
ously proposed as a valid estimate of the metabolic cost of walking [
31,32].  In addition,
the step cadence may also be a practical mode for prescribing exercise intensity in real
life.  At the end of the exercise session, participants remained seated for the remaining
experimental time.
2.7. Glycemic Assessment
Capillary blood glucose measures were regularly collected and analyzed by using
reactive strips and a glucometer (Contour
®
Next, Bayer HealthCare S.p.A., Milan, Italy).
Two measures were collected and the average of the two was considered. When a difference
greater than 10% between the two measures was found, a third measure was collected.
Glycemia was assessed at fasting and every 15 min after the meal, until the end of the visit
(Figure1). Before each measure was performed in any of the visits, participants washed
their hands in order to avoid possible alterations of the measure related to external factors.
2.8. Rating of Perceived Exertion
In both studies, during the exercise conditions (i.e., 0.75EX and 1.5EX, in Study 1, and
OGTT_EX and MEAL_EX, in Study 2), perceived exertion was evaluated using the rating
of perceived exertion (RPE) Borg’s 6–20 scale every 15 min during the 30 min walking (i.e.,
30 and 45 min from the beginning of the meal).
2.9. Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the software IBM SPSS statistics version 23.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The analyses performed were identical in both studies for
all variables.  Data normality was checked using the Shapiro–Wilk test.  The glycemic
time course was compared across conditions using a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA
(condition×time). In the case of significant interactions, the simple main effect of condition
at each time point was analyzed using a one-way repeated-measures ANOVA. Mean blood
glucose concentration at 0–120 min was also calculated and analyzed using a one-way
repeated-measures ANOVA. The time-averaged positive incremental area under the curve
(iAUC) was calculated at 0–60, 60–120, and 0–120 min [33]. A one-way repeated measures
ANOVA was used to analyze differences between conditions for positive iAUC. RPE values
were compared across conditions using a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA (condition
×time).
The Greenhouse–Geisser or the Huynh–Feldt corrections were used for adjusting the
degrees of freedom of the within-subject comparisons forε< 0.75 andε> 0.75, respectively.
In the case of significant differences, the least significant differences (LSD) correction was
used for the analysis of multiple comparisons. For all statistical tests, the level of significance
was set at 0.05. Partial eta squared (

4. Discussion
Improving the post-meal glycemic response is important for reducing cardiometabolic
disorders both in healthy individuals and in patients with diabetes [
1,7,12,35]. While 30 min
of postprandial walking has proven to be effective in attenuating the glycemic response
after a standard meal [
8], less is known on its efficacy in relation to the amount of CHO
provided with the meal or to its macronutrient composition. Hence, we performed two
studies collectively showing that 30 min of postprandial walking is:
(i)Effective in reducing the glucose peak both when increasing the CHO content of a
mixed meal and when consuming a CHO drink.
(ii)Less effective in improving the total glycemic response two hours after the meal when
the CHO content of a mixed meal is relatively high.
These findings have implications for planning exercise sessions aimed at improving
the postprandial glycemic response after meals with different characteristics.
The results of our two studies showed that performing 30 min of walking exercise,
started immediately after the meal, effectively attenuated the glucose peak after meals with
different CHO quantities and compositions. Study 1 showed that the post-meal glucose
56

Nutrients2022,14, 1080
peak was similarly reduced by exercise when the amount of CHO was either 0.75 or 1.5 g per
kg of body weight. This suggests that moderate-intensity exercise has an important impact
on the glucose peak after the consumption of a meal with a relatively high amount of CHO
in healthy individuals.  Likewise, a similar reduction in the glucose peak was observed
when participants performed moderate walking either after consuming an OGTT or a mixed
meal, even though the latter had a greater energy intake. This attenuation of the post-meal
glucose peak has implications for the reduction in the cardiometabolic disorders associated
with it, as suggested by the reduction in the levels of markers associated with oxidative
stress [36]. Our results extend previous findings on the effectiveness of postprandial exercise
in reducing the post-meal glycemic peak [8,14,16] to meals characterized by different CHO
levels and contents of macronutrients. This constitutes a step forward for suggesting the
implementation of a 30 min postprandial moderate walk in daily life scenarios, where the
meal content and composition may substantially vary.
Although we found a similar reduction in the glycemic peak after consuming mixed
meals with two different amounts of CHO (Study 1), the CHO content of the meal mod-
erated the effect of postprandial exercise on the glycemic response when considering the
first two hours after the meal.  Indeed, a substantial glycemic rebound was found after
exercise when participants consumed 1.5 g of CHO per kg of body weight, with higher
glycemic values observed throughout the second hour post-meal when compared with
the 0.75EX condition. The extent of the glycemic rebound in the 1.5EX condition can be
further appreciated when considering that the time-averaged glucose iAUC value was
significantly higher than that of the other three conditions (Figure2c). Although we did not
investigate the mechanisms underlying this effect, higher glycemic values may be related
to the longer release of the meal-derived glucose from the gastrointestinal system [37].
These findings suggest that when consuming a meal with a high CHO content, 30 min of
postprandial continuous walking started early after the meal are sufficient to elicit a marked
attenuation of the early glucose response, while it is less effective in the late postprandial
phase. In this context, other exercise strategies should be considered to improve the glucose
response over the entire post-meal period. For instance, previous evidence has shown the
effectiveness of spreading the exercise session into shorter activity breaks over the entire
postprandial period for preventing the glycemic rebound and improving the glucose iAUC
response [8,38–41]. Further studies should investigate whether activity breaks may also
provide a relevant stimulus for reducing the glucose levels over the two hours even when
the CHO content of a meal is high.
The comparison between the effects of postprandial exercise after a mixed meal or a
CHO drink matched for CHO content allowed us to gain further insight into the glycemic
response both from a methodological and practical perspective. While an OGTT is often
used in research to evaluate the effects of postprandial exercise on the glycemic response, it
does not generally reproduce real-life conditions, hence impacting on the applicability of
the study findings. We have compared the CHO drink with a mixed meal with the same
absolute content of CHO, which is similar to the standard meal that we have previously
used [
8].  As expected, the CHO drink consumption results in a more rapid increase in
glycemia and in higher glycemic values throughout the first two hours after the meal
compared with the glycemic response observed after the mixed meal. The presence of fat
and protein in the mixed meal may explain this difference between the OGTT and the mixed
meal. Indeed, several studies have shown that the presence of these macronutrients may
delay gastric emptying and attenuate the glycemic response [22,25,26]. Similarly, the greater
energy intake and the semi-solid composition of the mixed meal may also have contributed
to delaying gastric emptying compared with the OGTT [28]. It is also conceivable that the
greater insulin secretion that usually occurs after the consumption of a mixed meal may
have contributed to improving the glycemic response in that experimental condition [23].
These findings suggest caution when assessing the effect of postprandial exercise with
an OGTT test, as the factors determining glycemic control may differ compared with a
mixed meal, as also shown in previous studies [20,28]. From a practical perspective, this
57

Nutrients2022,14, 1080
comparison allowed us to show that exercise is effective even when a CHO-only drink is
consumed.
While we did not attempt to investigate the mechanisms underlying the effect of
postprandial exercise on glycemic control after meals with different characteristics, the
systematic manipulation of the meal has the potential to shed some light on this issue.
Indeed, different meals may have different effects on the factors affecting the rate of blood
glucose appearance and disappearance. This applies, for instance, to the glucose release
from the gastrointestinal system [37,42,43], and to insulin-dependent glucose uptake [44].
Hence, the manipulation of the meal should be accompanied by the assessment of relevant
hormonal (e.g., insulin levels) and physiological responses in future studies. An improved
understanding of the mechanisms underlying the interaction between meal and exercise
would further refine the prescription of postprandial exercise.
5. Conclusions
We conducted two studies assessing the efficacy of 30 min of postprandial brisk
walking  performed  15  min  after  meals  with  different  CHO  content  or  macronutrient
composition. Study 1 showed that exercise similarly reduces the glycemic peak after mixed
meals containing either 0.75 or 1.5 g of CHO per kg of body weight, while it is less effective
in improving the glycemic response throughout the first two hours post meal when the
amount of CHO in the meal is relatively higher. Study 2 showed that the glycemic response
differs both in time course and absolute values after an OGTT or a mixed meal matched for
CHO content, with similar improvements when postprandial exercise is performed.
Collectively, our findings show that 30 min of postprandial brisk walking is effective in
improving the glycemic response after meals with different CHO content or macronutrient
composition.  These results support the implementation of walking among the tools for
improving glycemic control in everyday life scenarios, where the content and composition
of a meal may vary substantially. This study was performed in young, healthy individuals,
and further studies are required to evaluate whether similar responses may occur in older,
unfit, or individuals with metabolic disorders.

Abstract:Growing evidence supports the importance of lifestyle and environmental exposures—
collectively referred to as the ‘exposome’—for ensuring immune health. In this narrative review, we
summarize and discuss the effects of the different exposome components (physical activity, body
weight management, diet, sun exposure, stress, sleep and circadian rhythms, pollution, smoking,
and gut microbiome) on immune function and inflammation,  particularly in the context of the
current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We highlight the potential role of ‘exposome
improvements’ in the prevention—or amelioration, once established—of this disease as well as their
effect on the response to vaccination. In light of the existing evidence, the promotion of a healthy
exposome should be a cornerstone in the prevention and management of the COVID-19 pandemic
and other eventual pandemics.

1. Introduction
After the reemergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus
(SARS-CoV) in 2003, Cheng et al. [1] warned (in 2007) of the need to take measures aimed
at preventing the possibility that SARS—or other viruses—returning if conditions are fit
for their introduction, mutation, amplification, and transmission. In light of the more than
233 million cases and 4.7 million deaths worldwide, according to data from The Johns
Hopkins University (updated as of 30 September 2021) [2], caused by the current pandemic
of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it seems clear that countries are not prepared to
deal with an emergency that had already been predicted 13 years earlier. Yet, the COVID-19
pandemic is just one of the many pandemics that are likely to come in the foreseeable
future [3].
Combining a healthy lifestyle with environmental exposure could be an important
companion measure to vaccines and medications for the prophylaxis and treatment of
future pandemics (Figure1). The implementation of healthy lifestyles and environmental
exposures can still play a key role in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic,

potentially contributing to the prevention of new cases or the improvement of the prognosis
of infected patients [
4–8]. These lifestyle measures will be explained in detail from Section2
to Section9and mainly include performing regular physical activity, avoiding obesity,
following a diet rich in fresh fruits,  vegetables,  polyphenols,  micronutrients and fish-
derived omega-3 fatty acids (e.g., the Mediterranean diet) that together can contribute to
attenuate inflammation, minimizing psychosocial stress and exposure to environmental
pollutants, following healthy sleeping patterns, and avoiding smoking.  In this regard,
a study conducted with twins revealed that, compared with genetic endowment, non-
heritable factors seem to be the strongest contributors to individual variability in immune
responses [9]. Indeed, various lifestyles and environmental factors cannot only modulate
immune responses [10–13] but also individual response to vaccination [14].

The relevance of lifestyle/environmental factors for health has been extensively evi-
denced [
15]. However, most epidemiological studies have focused almost exclusively on
single exposures. Since health status obviously depends on multiple variables [16], a more
comprehensive paradigm that considers the exposure to different endogenous and envi-
ronmental factors collectively is emerging, the so-called exposome. Briefly, the exposome
refers to life-course exposures starting from the prenatal period onward [17]. This holistic
approach might help to gain insight into the influence of lifestyle/environmental factors
on human health [18–22]. The exposome encompasses two broad categories of non-genetic
exposures: individual-level (physical activity, weight management, diet, stress, sleep and
circadian rhythms, pollution, smoking, as well as the gut microbiome) and general expo-
sures (climate and sunlight, environmental pollution), respectively [23].  Of interest, all
these exposures can act synergistically through common mechanisms, such as the nuclear
factor binding near the k light-chain gene in the B cells (NF-κB) family of transcriptional fac-
tors and the inflammasome machinery—the innate immune system receptors and sensors
that regulate the activation of caspase-1 and induce inflammation in response to infec-
tious microbes and host-derived molecules, the so-called damage-associated molecular
patterns—and subsequent inflammation [24].
In the present narrative (non-systematic) review, we aim to summarize the effect
of the exposome (including physical activity, weight management, diet, vitamin D and
sun exposure, stress, sleep and circadian rhythms, exposure to environmental pollution,
smoking, and gut microbiome) on inflammation and immune function, with a focus on
the potential role of lifestyle changes in the prevention—or amelioration once established—
of  infectious  diseases  such  as  COVID-19,  as  well  as  their  influence  on  the  efficacy  of
vaccines. Our objective is to draw attention to the potential importance of complementary
lifestyle-related measures in order to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and possible future
pandemics, which should be implemented along with other established measures such as
vaccination and medical treatments.
2. Physical Activity
Approximately one-quarter of the population worldwide is considered physically
inactive (that is, not meeting the minimum international recommendations, i.e., at least
150 or 75 min/weekof moderate (such as walking) or vigorous (such as very brisk walking)
aerobic activities, respectively) [
25]. There is evidence that in the context of the current pan-
demic, preventive measures such as social distancing and forced lockdown have increased
sedentary behaviors and physical inactivity [26–30]. Of relevance, physical inactivity can
promote baseline inflammation and several related pathophysiologic alterations including,
among others, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, vascular endothelial dysfunction, high
blood pressure, and sarcopenia [
24,31]. Consistent with these effects, physical inactivity
has been described as a contributor to over 35 chronic conditions [31].
Conversely, the beneficial effects of regular physical activity (PA) on immune function
are well documented.  Regular PA is associated with a 31% and 37% risk reduction of
community-acquired infectious diseases and subsequent mortality, respectively, compared
to inactive controls [32].  Physical exercise interventions can increase CD4 lymphocyte
counts and salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentration and decrease neutrophil counts
compared  to  controls  [32].   In  fact,  even  just  four  weeks  of  either  moderate-  or  high-
intensity interval exercise can lead to a remarkable improvement in natural killer (NK)
cell number and function (i.e., ‘killing capacity’) [33]. Regular exercise can also attenuate
immunosenescence[34], that is, the progressive immune dysfunction that occurs as we age,
with remodeling of lymphoid organs and a higher susceptibility to infections.
Acute bouts of exercise also provide some benefits to the immune system, stimu-
lating the interchange of innate immune cells between lymphoid tissues and the blood
compartment, while improving immunosurveillance against pathogens and decreasing
systemic inflammation [35]. Indeed, muscle contractions induce the release of hundreds of
molecules—mostly but not only small peptides (cytokines) collectively known asmyokines—
63

Nutrients2022,14,24
from skeletal muscles (but also from other tissues, in which case they are broadly termed
exerkines) into the bloodstream, thereby reaching other tissues and organs where they elicit
myriad beneficial effects, including anti-inflammatory ones [36,37].  Thus, the beneficial
effects of regular PA can be attributed, at least in part, to the accumulation of frequent,
repeated ‘time windows’ (i.e., during exertion and in the following hours) where myokines
(orexerkines) are being released to the blood with the subsequent salutary effects. Notably,
when it is released from the working muscles and thus acts as a myokine, interleukin (IL)-6
exerts anti-inflammatory effects and can stimulate NK cells, an effect that is not observed
under resting conditions. In fact, IL-6 released from other sources, such as immune cells, in
a non-exercise milieu, has a pro-inflammatory role [38].
A high level of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), which can be achieved through reg-
ular exercise practice, has been associated with fewer days (
−46%) of illness from acute
respiratory infections as compared with a low level of CRF [39]. A high CRF has also been
reported to positively impact the expression of immune markers that could theoretically
reduce the risk of COVID-19 complications [40], particularly the so-calledcytokine storm
syndrome [
40]; that is, the excessive, uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines
(e.g., interferon-
γ, IL-1, IL-6, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α) to the bloodstream
that is frequently found in patients with severe disease, including COVID-19 [41]. In the
same line, CRF has been reported to be independently and inversely associated with the
likelihood of hospitalization for COVID-19 [42].
Physical exercise might also be beneficial in improving the efficacy of vaccines against
SARS-coronavirus (CoV)-2 [32,43] and other infectious agents. Both ‘acute’ (i.e., a single
session) or regular exercise (repeated sessions) prior to influenza vaccination are safe and
can enhance the immune response to vaccination [44,45].  Edwards et al.  showed that
performing eccentric contractions of the deltoid and biceps brachii muscles of the non-
dominant arm 6 h before influenza vaccination in the same arm improved cell-mediated
response (as reflected by enhanced interferon-γresponses) in men and increased antibody
responses in women [46].  A meta-analysis by Chastin et al.  found that regular exercise
increases antibody titers after vaccination against influenza, pneumococcal, or varicella
zoster virus, respectively [32]. There is also evidence from interventional research support-
ing the beneficial role of regular exercise. Notably, a study with participants aged ~70 years
who were previously sedentary and had poor influenza vaccine responses found that those
randomized to moderate-intensity cardiovascular exercise showed marked improvements
in influenza seroprotection throughout the entire influenza season compared to the control
group [47].  In addition, exercise may minimize the deleterious effects of immunosenes-
cence on vaccination efficacy by maintaining the peripheral T-cell pool and the ability of
these cells to respond to novel vaccine antigens. Physically active, older adults are known
to have fewer and more ‘senescent’ and naïve T cells, respectively, than their sedentary
counterparts.  Importantly, preserving a diverse pool of both functional (non-senescent)
and naïve T-cells is likely to reduce infection risk, and the regular release of muscle-derived
cytokines such as IL-7 and IL-15 has been purported to play important roles in the beneficial
effects of exercise on immunity [34].  Furthermore, elderly women who were physically
active had a better immune response after vaccination than those who were less active [48].
Although more studies are needed to confirm its efficacy, acute exertion (i.e., a single session
of relatively intense exercise performed just prior to vaccination) has also been postulated
as an effective strategy to increase the immune response to vaccination [44].
3. Body Weight Management
The worldwide prevalence of obesity has almost tripled since 1975, with 39% and
13% of adults now considered to have overweight and obesity, respectively [49]. Excessive
adiposity, especially central adiposity—accumulation of fat in the lower torso around the ab-
dominal area—is detrimental to health, with consistent evidence showing that overweight
and obesity are associated with an increased risk of associated comorbidities—mainly, but
64

Nutrients2022,14,24
not only, cardiovascular disease (CVD) [50]. Furthermore, obesity is overall associated with
accelerated ageing and subsequent immune dysfunction, the so-calledadipaging[51].
There is meta-analytical evidence that individuals with obesity are not only at greater
risk of COVID-19 infection but also of having a worse prognosis (higher risk of severe
disease and mortality) than their normal-weight peers [52–54]. Several mechanisms could
contribute to the detrimental effects of obesity on immune function. Excess of adiposity,
particularly around abdominal organs (i.e., visceral adipose tissue), is characterized by
increased production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other molecules, the
so-calledadipocytokinesoradipokines[55], which could lead to low-grade chronic inflamma-
tion (LGCI) and contribute to several chronic inflammatory conditions. Excess of adiposity
has been reported to exert modulatory effects on key populations of immune cells that are
critical for ensuring an adequate response to SARS-CoV-2 [56]. Obesity is also associated
with both a reduced number of NK lymphocytes and a lower cytotoxic capacity of these
cells [57,58]. On the other hand, leptin, one of the most abundant adipokines produced by
adipocytes, affects both innate and adaptive immunity [59,60]. Notably, leptin increases
the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in monocytes and macrophages [61]. Thus, a
positive correlation between circulating leptin and inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive
protein [CRP], IL-6, TNF-α) has been suggested [62]. In this context, obesity is frequently as-
sociated with leptin resistance, a phenomenon traditionally attributed to impaired transport
of this molecule through the blood–brain barrier that leads to increased leptin levels [63].
This, in turn, leads to the dysregulation of cytokine production, increased susceptibility to
infectious diseases, autoimmune conditions, and upregulated inflammatory responses [60],
and could explain why many obesity-associated comorbidities have been linked to im-
mune dysfunction [
64].  Moreover, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 expression
in adipose tissue exceeds that of the lung tissue [
65].  Since ACE2 is an important entry
receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [66], elevated levels of this membrane receptor, as a consequence
of excess adipose tissue, could promote viral entrance into target cells and increase the risk
of COVID-19 infection.
Some comorbidities linked to obesity are also associated with higher COVID-19 sever-
ity. Obesity is often associated with respiratory dysfunction, which increases the risk of
hypoventilation, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiac stress, worsening COVID-19 prog-
nosis [67]. People with obesity have impaired ventilatory mechanics, as excess adiposity
causes a decrease in expiratory reserve volume, leading to lower levels of both functional
residual capacity and total lung capacity [68].  Overall, these effects can lead to lower
CRF levels which, as mentioned above, have been inversely associated with the risk of
COVID-19 hospitalization [42].
Obese individuals show an impaired response to vaccination compared to normal-
weight individuals, as a recent study with 248 healthcare workers who were vaccinated
against COVID-19 with the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine suggests [
69].  This is
in line with previous evidence that obesity could decrease the immune response after
vaccination against hepatitis B [70,71], rabies [72], tetanus [73], or influenza [74]. Different
mechanisms might explain an obesity-induced impairment in response to vaccination. On
the one hand, due to excessive adiposity, individuals with obesity could receive a lower
relative vaccination dose or experience reduced absorption from the site of injection [73].
Alternatively, obesity-induced LGCI might reduce the immune response to vaccines [73].
In summary, excess adiposity can lead to a pro-inflammatory status, also known as
metaflammation [
75], with subsequent immune dysfunction (e.g., impaired innate and
adaptative response to infectious agents and vaccines) and respiratory dysfunction, thereby
worsening prognosis after virus infections. Thus, body weight management should be a key
public health concern in the prevention/management of the current COVID-19 pandemic
and future pandemics.

4. Diet
The westernised way of life has brought several changes to the human diet, particularly
the widespread consumption of ultra-processed foods with a high content of fat, sugar, salt,
and flavour additives that can cause an excess calorie intake [76]. These features contribute
to obesity, which, as previously discussed, can lead to a proinflammatory status, impair
immune function, and increase the risk of many chronic diseases (Figure2).

patterns on inflammation. Abbreviations: AGEs, advanced glycation end products; CRP, C-reactive
protein; IL-6, interleukin-6; MACs, microbiota-accessible carbohydrates; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB;

necrosis factor. Source: Self-elaboration based on the main results obtained in the scientific literature.
The abundance of food and the way it is consumed in Western countries has led to
dietary patterns characterized by several meals per day consumed in a very long eating
window.   Thus,  feeding  periods longer  than 14  h have been  described in  overweight
individuals [77]. However, when overweight individuals with >14 h eating duration ate for
only 10–11 h per day over 16 weeks, they reduced their energy intake by 20% and showed a
reduction in total body weight (−3.27 kg) and body mass index (−1.15 kg/m
2
)[77]. In this
effect, intermittent fasting and particularly time-restricted feeding (TRF) protocols have
gained popularity in recent years because they might help adults with obesity to lose weight.
However, controversy exists, and in fact, meta-analytical evidence indicates no significant
difference in weight loss when comparing intermittent (i.e., TRF) or continuous energy
restriction interventions [
78–81].  This being said, TRF might produce larger metabolic
benefits even in the absence of weight loss, including increases in insulin sensitivity and
decreases in blood pressure or oxidative stress [82].
Controversy  also  exists  on  the  influence  of  TRF  on  inflammation.   The  available
evidence suggests that TRF has no effects on inflammatory markers such as CRP, IL-6, or
TNF-α[82–86], although it is possible that different types of TRF could produce different
effects.  For instance, a study conducted during the Ramadan period, 16 h fasting from
sunrise to sunset throughout 29 consecutive days, showed that this type of TRF increased
IL-6 levels but also induced a reduction in TNF-αand CRP [87]. Other beneficial effects
of intermittent fasting could involve metabolic switching and cellular resistance stress,
although the specific mechanisms remain unclear [88].
66

Nutrients2022,14,24
Beyond its obesogenic effect, westernized diets represent a major source of advanced
glycation end products (AGEs) [89]; that is, proteins, nucleic acids, or lipids that become
non-enzymatically glycated as a result of exposure to reducing sugars. Dietary AGEs are
typically found in foods cooked under dry heat (such as grilling, broiling, roasting, and
frying) or exposed to thermal treatments, with processed and ultra-processed foods being
a major source of these compounds. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials
(RCT) found that AGEs-rich diets can increase TNF-αas well as 8-isoprostane, a marker
of oxidative stress [90]. There is a growing body of evidence that closely links AGEs with
chronic diseases [89,91,92]. Conversely, meta-analytical evidence suggests that reducing
dietary AGEs can lower circulating AGEs as well as the receptor for these compounds,
which translates into a reduction in TNF-α, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1),
8-isoprostane, and leptin, respectively, together with an increase in adiponectin and sirtuin-
1[93]. Western diets typically also include high glycemic load ingredients, such as sugars
and refined cereal grains.  These have been shown, in mononuclear cells from healthy
individuals, to increase the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activate redox-
sensitive transcription factors, such as NF-κB, which upregulates the expression of various
proinflammatory genes [94,95]. Other potential dietary triggers of inflammation that are
present in excess in the Western diet include alcohol, salt, industrial trans fatty acids, and
certain saturated fatty acids (particularly palmitic acid), all of which have been shown to
cause inflammation through different mechanisms [96–99]. For instance, a high-salt diet
may favour polarization of macrophages towards a pro-inflammatory (M1) phenotype,
skew the balance between the proinflammatory T helper (Th)17 lymphocytes and the
anti-inflammatory T regulatory (reg) cells, and may adversely change the microbiome [96],
which, as will be discussed later, also affects inflammation and overall immune function.
Conversely, increasing potassium intake has been shown to neutralize salt-loading-induced
Th17 activation [100,101].
Giving support to the role of dietary factors in LGCI, various intervention studies
have shown that hypercaloric fast-food meals (which are high in AGEs, sugars, refined
grains, salt, and hydrogenated or saturated fats) increase the concentration of various
proinflammatory molecules, even in lean healthy individuals [102,103]. Moreover, there is
evidence associating westernised diets with increased serum CRP levels [104]. Westernised
dietary patterns also tend to be low in fresh fruits and vegetables. This is relevant since a low
intake of these food groups is considered one of the main diet-related risk factors according
to the Global Burden of Disease Study [105,106] that estimated that poor dietary patterns
were responsible for 11 million deaths worldwide (even outrunning smoking) in 2017 [105].
Interestingly, since fruits and vegetables are major sources of the so-called microbiota-
accessible carbohydrates, reducing their intake can decrease the richness and diversity of
the gut microbiota, which, as reviewed below, can contribute to LGCI [107,108]. Conversely,
diets with a high content of fruits and vegetables have been reported to decrease circulating
concentrations of TNF-αand CRP while increasing gamma-delta T lymphocytes (a group
of T cells that are abundant in the gut mucosa known as ‘intraepithelial lymphocytes’) [109].
Foods that are rich in fruits or vegetables have also been shown to prevent or attenuate
the oxidative and inflammatory stress induced by hypercaloric fast food meals [110–113].
This has mainly been attributed to their high content of several bioactive compounds
involved in the regulation of genes that affect the inflammatory response and antioxidant
status [114,115]. In addition, foods rich in fruits and vegetables are high in various minerals
and vitamins reported to decrease oxidative stress and inflammation while improving
overall immune function (i.e., potassium [100,101], magnesium [116,117], and vitamins B9
(folate [118–120]), C [121,122], and E [123]).
Other important micronutrients for immune health are zinc, copper, iron, and sele-
nium, as well as vitamins A, B6, B12, and D. The impact of these micronutrients on viral
infections has been extensively reviewed elsewhere [5,120,124,125].  As for vitamin D, it
will be discussed at length in a later section. Of note, the nutritional status of zinc, copper,
and selenium has been correlated with severity and mortality due to COVID-19 [126–128].
67

Nutrients2022,14,24
Accordingly, two observational studies found an association between zinc supplementation
and better outcomes in COVID-19 hospitalized patients [129,130]. However, supplementa-
tion with high-dose zinc, vitamin C, or a combination of the two nutrients in ambulatory
COVID-19 patients did not reduce the duration of symptoms compared with standard
care [131]. Patients who might benefit the most from increasing the intake of these nutri-
ents are those who are zinc and/or vitamin C-deficient [132], or have severe and critical
COVID-19 since those typically present with high-grade inflammation [
133], which can
significantly affect the status of zinc [
134] and vitamin C [135]. What seems clear is that,
in times of the pandemic, it is essential to cover any nutritional deficiencies through an
adequate diet and specific nutritional supplementation if applicable [136].
An optimal nutritional status can affect not only the outcome of an infection but also
vaccination efficacy.  Indeed, malnutrition might produce a lower antibody response to
vaccination in children [137–141]. On the other hand, chronic overfeeding can cause obesity,
which, as mentioned above, can lead to an impaired response to vaccination [142,143].
Interestingly, not only lean malnourished individuals but also obese people can present
with multiple micronutrient deficiencies [144–146]. This is relevant because there is some
evidence (albeit still limited) that zinc, copper, selenium, and iron, as well as vitamins A,
B6, B9, B12, C, D, and E, might affect the immune response to various vaccines [124].
The daily consumption of five or more portions of fruits and vegetables per day has
been shown, in an RCT, to improve the antibody response to Pneumovax II vaccination in
healthy participants aged 65–85 years [147]. A study that included 3,042 individuals of both
sexes showed that those with higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet (characterized by
a high intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains, fish and olive oil, moderate
consumption of dairy products and red wine, and low consumption of red meat [148]) had
20%, 17%, 14%, 15%, and 6% lower levels of CRP, IL-6, white blood cell counts, homocys-
teine, and fibrinogen, than individuals with low adherence to the diet, respectively [149].
Consuming a Mediterranean diet modulated specific components of the gut microbiome
of non-frail or pre-frail participants from several European countries, with microbiome
changes associated with a reduction in the risk of frailty, an improvement in cognitive func-
tion, and a decrease in the circulating levels of two inflammatory markers, high-sensitivity
CRP (hsCRP) and IL-17 [150]. In addition, results from the Moli-sani study including 14,586
healthy individuals showed that white blood cell and platelet counts were both inversely
related to Mediterranean diet adherence [151].  Meta-analytical evidence indicates that
high adherence to a Mediterranean diet attenuates inflammation and improves vascular
endothelial function by increasing adiponectin and flow-mediated dilatation while decreas-
ing hsCRP, IL-6, and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 [
152]. Accordingly, adherence to the
Mediterranean diet has been associated with a lower incidence (and related mortality) of
CVD, cancer, and neurodegenerative conditions, as well as with all-cause mortality [
153].
Even if compared to a low-fat diet, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin
olive oil or nuts has been associated with a lower rate of major CVD events in individuals
at high risk for CVD [154].  These results might be explained by the salutary—notably,
antioxidant and immunomodulator—effects of certain dietary components of the Mediter-
ranean diet. These include polyphenols [155,156] (found in fruits and vegetables, nuts, and
extra virgin olive oil), micronutrients (such as magnesium [116,117], vitamins B9 [118–120],
C[121,122] and E [123]), and fish-derived omega-3 fatty acids (which stimulate the reso-
lution of inflammation by giving rise to molecules, the so-called specialized proresolving
mediators) [157]. Hence, due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory
benefits, and its protective effect against predictors of morbidity and mortality in patients
with COVID-19 such as CVD, the Mediterranean diet could be a promising and relatively
easy-to-apply method to attenuate the severity of SARS-CoV-2 and eventual future viral
pandemics [158,159].  In fact, a study showed that adherence to the Mediterranean diet
was inversely associated with COVID-19 cases and related deaths in Spain and across
23 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries [160].

5. Vitamin D and Sun Exposure
While traditionally known for its role in bone metabolism and skeletal muscle func-
tion [161], vitamin D has recently gained attention as an important player in immune
health [
162].  Vitamin D modulates both the adaptive and innate arms of the immune
system [162] and might improve the inflammatory response to viral infection [163,164]. In
fact, a Mendelian randomization study with 35,833 participants showed that low levels of
plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin (OH)D, a biomarker of vitamin D status, were associated with a
higher risk of bacterial pneumonias during a 38-year follow-up [
165]. Additionally, vitamin
D deficiency has been associated with an increase in proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α,
IL-6) [166,167].  Preclinical studies have shown that vitamin D polarizes macrophages
towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype, thereby reducing the secretion of proinflam-
matory cytokines such as IL-6 or TNF-
α[168,169].  Moreover, vitamin D can polarize T
CD4+ lymphocytes from a pro- (Th1/Th17) to an anti-inflammatory (Treg) phenotype,
respectively [162]. Furthermore, this vitamin regulates the expression of genes that code for
antimicrobial proteins in dendritic cells and macrophages [
162]. A recent systematic review
and meta-analysis of case-control, cross-sectional, and prospective cohort studies showed a
significant and non-linear correlation between 25(OH)D levels below 37.5 nmol/L on the
one hand, and risk and severity of acute respiratory tract infection on the other [170]. There
is also meta-analytical evidence that vitamin D supplementation can reduce the incidence
of respiratory infections and asthma exacerbations, especially in people with vitamin D
deficiency [171,172].
Hence, vitamin D can affect the prognosis of COVID-19. Those European countries
with lower reported plasma levels of vitamin D in the population, such as Spain and Italy
(especially in older people), had the highest mortality rates from COVID-19 early in the
pandemic [173,174]. In addition, vitamin D deficiency has been associated with a greater
susceptibility to COVID-19 infection [175,176] and a greater risk of intensive care unit (ICU)
admission in infected patients [
177], with lower vitamin D levels reported for patients with
a severe course of the disease [178,179].  Accordingly, there is evidence suggesting that
vitamin D supplementation can have a positive effect on COVID-19 symptoms and severity.
Compared with a lower dose (1000 IU), daily oral supplementation with 5000 IU of vitamin
D3 for two weeks reduced the time to recovery of symptoms such as cough and gustatory
sensory loss among mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients with sub-optimal vitamin D
status [
180].  Further, a meta-analysis including 13 studies and 2933 patients found that
vitamin D supplementation was associated with a reduced risk of adverse outcomes, ICU
admission, and mortality from COVID-19 [181]. Interestingly, vitamin D supplementation
was associated with improved clinical outcomes, especially when administered after the
diagnosis of COVID-19 and not in patients who received vitamin D before diagnosis [181].
The benefits of vitamin D on COVID-19 complications could be due to its effects on the
production of antimicrobial and antiviral proteins, as well as on the modulation of the
inflammatory response, thereby preventing (or suppressing) the cytokine storm [182].
Yet there is some controversy on the potential benefits of vitamin D. A recent ret-
rospective  study  determined  that  25(OH)D  levels  above  40  nmol/L  were  not  able  to
adequately predict in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 [
183].  A systematic
review and meta-analysis found no significant effect of vitamin-D supplementation on
major health-related outcomes in COVID-19 (such as mortality, ICU admission rates or need
for invasive ventilation) [184]. A multi-center, double-blind, placebo-RCT trial did not find
any beneficial effect on length of hospitalization among patients with COVID-19 receiving
a single high oral dose of vitamin D3 (200,000 IU). This finding could also be explained
by the fact that vitamin D supplementation prevents acute respiratory infections (e.g.,
COVID-19) when given as low-dose daily maintenance, but not as high-dose intermittent
bolus [185,186].
69

Nutrients2022,14,24
The potential role of vitamin D on vaccine responses seems unclear [187]. Zimmerman
et al. found that low vitamin D levels at baseline were associated with higher antibody titers
in response to the human papillomavirus vaccine in young male adults [188]. However, a
systematic review and meta-analysis failed to find a significant association between vitamin
D status and the immunogenic response to influenza vaccination, although a lower seropro-
tective response to vaccination with some strains of influenza was observed in patients with
vitamin D deficiency [189]. A placebo, double-blind RCT found no differences of serum
levels of cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (a polypeptide that is primarily stored in the
lysosomes of macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes), antibody titers, and ROS
production 28 days after the influenza vaccine between cholecalciferol supplementation and
placebo in deficient elderly persons, despite the former increasing vitamin D levels [190].
However, the supplementation group showed a reduced Th1/Th2 ratio after vaccination
(coinciding with the end of the 3-month period with vitamin D supplementation) as well as
low plasma levels of TNF-αand IL-6, together with higher levels of transforming growth
factor-β28 days post-vaccination [190]. Intramuscular co-administration of calcitriol, also
known as 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D
3
, the active form of vitamin D, at a site adjacent to
an influenza vaccination did not enhance subsequent serum hemagglutination inhibition
titers to any of the vaccine antigens compared to a placebo [191].  In a recent RCT, oral
vitamin D supplementation or simulated sunlight exposure beginning three days after a
hepatitis B vaccination, and achieving vitamin D sufficiency within five weeks, did not
influence the response to vaccination [
192].  Although more studies are needed to build
stronger evidence [
193], given the potential benefits of vitamin D for immune health in
general and the safety of its supplementation, “there is nothing to lose and much to gain by
achieving an optimal vitamin D status” in those people affected by COVID-19 [194].
Ultraviolet radiation exerts immunomodulatory effects independent of vitamin D [195].
For instance, ultraviolet radiation-induced immunosuppression is key to the development
of carcinogenesis in the skin [196]. In addition to causing immune suppression, exposure
to ultraviolet light induces a shift from a Th1- to a Th2-mediated response,  increases
regulatory T cell function, augments macrophage differentiation, and inhibits plasma cell
differentiation [197]. However, the clinical implications of these effects are not entirely clear.
On the one hand, the skin area that has been exposed chronically to ultraviolet radiation
(such as that above the deltoid muscle) may not be an optimal site for the delivery of
vaccines because their efficacy could be compromised, with unexposed sites (e.g., buttock,
inside of the upper arm) being potentially more suitable [198].  Moreover, higher levels
of antibody titers were found in children who received the rubella vaccine in the winter
(with lower exposure to ultraviolet radiation and hence lower vitamin D levels) compared
with their summer-inoculated peers [199].  This suggests that sun exposure may impair
the efficacy of vaccines.  By contrast,  hepatitis B vaccine responses have proven to be
poorer in winter than summer [192]. In cold and temperate climates, annual epidemics of
influenza and the common cold occur during autumn and winter [22], when there is less
sunlight and hence lower levels of vitamin D-stimulating ultraviolet radiation. Furthermore,
the  influenza  virus  is  rapidly  inactivated  when  exposed  to  ultraviolet  radiation  from
sunlight [
200].   Interestingly,  both  SARS  and  COVID-19  have  emerged  during  winter
months  [
201]  and  a  recent  study  estimated  that  cold  and  dry  weather,  together  with
low  levels  of  ultraviolet  radiation,  is  moderately  associated  with  higher  SARS-CoV-2
transmissibility [202]. All this being said, it is too early to draw definitive conclusions on
sun exposure and COVID-19.
6. Stress
The prevalence of mental health issues increased in April 2020 compared to pre-
COVID-19 trends [203,204], with a recent systematic review and meta-analysis reporting
that approximately one-third of the general population showed symptoms of stress during
the COVID-19 pandemic [205]. Psychological stress can trigger immune dysfunction [206].
Brief episodes of stress, like the ones experienced during an exam or a first date, tend to sup-
70

Nutrients2022,14,24
press cellular immunity while preserving humoral immunity, whereas chronic stressors are
associated with the suppression of both cellular and humoral measures [
207]. Psychological
stress has been associated in a dose-response manner with a higher risk of acute respiratory
infections [
208], and the link between psychological stress and several chronic conditions is
well established, particularly for clinical depression, CVD, and human immunodeficiency
virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome [209]. There is meta-analytic evidence for a
direct association between acute stress and inflammatory biomarkers (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10,
TNF-
α)[210].  Several forms of chronic stress (such as job stress, immigration status, or
poverty) have been correlated to elevated levels of hsCRP or CRP [211–213]. Conversely,
there is recent meta-analytical evidence that mindfulness-based interventions aiming to
reduce stress can induce modest but significant reductions in markers of LGCI (hsCRP, IL-6,
TNF, and NF-κB activation) [214]. Chronic stress is also believed to trigger ‘inflammaging’
(that is, the chronic LGCI that is frequently associated with aging), partly through increases
in oxidative stress [215]. This might also be relevant for vaccine efficacy. Indeed, a meta-
analysis concluded that psychological stress could decrease antibody response to influenza
vaccination [216]. However, stress levels in the 10 days after influenza vaccination appeared
to be more influential to the antibody response than stress in the 2 days prior, with stress-
related loss of sleep being primarily responsible for reducing the humoral immune response
post-vaccination [217]. Regardless, both short-term (e.g., an academic examination) and
long-term stressors (e.g., caregiving) can impair vaccine responses [
218–223].  A poorer
virus-specific T-cell response following influenza vaccination was observed in caregivers of
Alzheimer’s disease patients compared to control individuals [224]. The aforementioned
evidence suggests that psychological stress can contribute to LGCI and impair the normal
response to infections and vaccines, which is relevant to the current pandemic situation.
Although we didn’t find evidence directly linking COVID-19 infection with psycholog-
ical disorders (such as depression), the stressful situations faced by the overall population
during the pandemic are likely to impair immune function and, consequently, increase
the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and perhaps even affect vaccination efficacy.  Accord-
ingly, stress management techniques (e.g., meditation, relaxation techniques and Yoga)
that modulate the immune response through various mechanisms (e.g., reducing LGCI,
as indicated by lowered levels of circulating IL-6 and TNF-α[214]) could be a potentially
effective strategy to attenuate the virus effect on health [214,225–227]. There is also meta-
analytic evidence linking regular PA with 45% and 28–48% lower odds of depression and
anxiety symptoms, respectively [228]. In addition, a recent umbrella review including 16
meta-analyses and 152 RCT concluded that regular physical exercise can be an effective
adjunctive treatment for improving symptoms across a broad range of mental disorders
(such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder) [229].
7. Sleep and Circadian Disruption
Numerous behaviors that are prevalent in westernised countries can result in sleep
disorders, including shift work, long working hours, as well as 24-h access to artificial
light (shops, telephone, television, or the Internet).  In this context, sleep disturbances
are emerging as another consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is longitudinal
evidence that the lockdown, imposed during the pandemic, had a negative impact on the
sleep quality of a Spanish cohort [27].  Moreover, a study in over 5000 Canadian adults
showed that the proportion of individuals with clinically meaningful sleep difficulties
markedly increased from before (36%) to after the COVID-19 pandemic (50.5%) [230].
Lack of sleep and circadian disruption is associated with immune dysfunction and
a pro-inflammatory status [
13,231,232]. Sleep deprivation upregulates inflammatory cy-
tokines such as TNF-
α, IL-1, or IL-6 [233].  In older adults, ageing-related alterations in
nocturnal wake time and daytime sleepiness are associated with elevations of both plasma
IL-6 and cortisol concentrations [234]. In fact, Atienza et al. suggested that the combination
of abnormal sleep, circadian disruption, and impaired immune response promotes inflam-
mation [235]. In addition, sleep deprivation is associated with the decline in the number of
71

Nutrients2022,14,24
myeloid dendritic cell precursors producing IL-12, a main inducer of Th1 responses [236].
These results support the importance of an optimal sleep for health maintenance, par-
ticularly in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic.  On the other hand, a recent
meta-analysis found that long sleep duration, as well as sleep disturbances, was associ-
ated with higher levels of CRP and IL-6 [
237]. A study with 1,310 individuals from Italy
showed that, during home confinement, participants reported a lower sleep quality despite
spending more time in bed [238]. This finding might be attributed to various factors such
as stress and circadian disruption. The latter can be caused by exposure to light at night,
which is associated with reduced melatonin synthesis [239,240]. Melatonin has important
properties as an immunomodulator agent that exerts anti-inflammatory effects [241,242]
while also stimulating the production of NK and CD4+ cells and inhibiting the release
of CD8+ cells [
243]. Yet the most documented function of melatonin is the regulation of
circadian rhythms. In this regard, circadian disruption (independently of sleep loss), such
as that suffered by night-shift workers, has been shown to increase hsCRP levels [244,245].
Since inadequate sleep along with circadian disruption can promote LGCI and con-
tribute to inmunosenescence, it might also affect the immune response to infections and
vaccines. In fact, each additional hour of sleep was shown to increase the secondary an-
tibody levels after hepatitis B vaccination by 56% [
246], whereas sleeping <6 h per night
was associated with a lower likelihood of showing a clinically protective response to the
vaccination vs.   sleeping <7 h per night [246].   Compared to no sleep,  sleep enhances
immune memory, thereby generating benefits of antigen-specific T-helper cell response
after hepatitis A vaccination that were maintained one year later [247]. On the other hand,
more studies are needed to confirm whether acute sleep deprivation can affect the human
antibody titer response to vaccination, since short-term studies have yielded conflicting
results.  For instance, sleep restriction before and after influenza vaccination, despite a
prolonged period of sleep recovery following vaccine administration, decreased antibody
titers 10 days after vaccination [248].  However, the short-term negative effects of sleep
on the antibody response apparently disappeared from 3 to 4 weeks after vaccination,
because antibody titers no longer differed among sleep-restricted individuals and those
who maintained their usual bedtime prior to receiving the vaccine [248]. Likewise, sleep de-
privation in the night after vaccination against influenza virus caused a lower antibody titer
response 5 days after vaccination, although it did not affect antibody titers thereafter [249].
Notwithstanding, evidence consistently suggests a key a role for circadian rhythms and
sleep on immune system homeostasis [250] and hence the timing of vaccination might also
affect the immune response. Accordingly, men vaccinated in the morning vs. afternoon
had a better peak antibody response to both hepatitis A and influenza vaccines [251].
Given  the  importance  of  sleep  for  immune  health  and  the  negative  effect  of  the
COVID-19 pandemic on sleep characteristics in most individuals, the promotion of ‘chronic’
interventions aimed at improving sleep quality such as regular exercise [252] and circadian
synchronization [253] should be kept in mind in view of future pandemics.
8. Exposure to Environmental Pollution
Exposure to persistent organic pollutants—that is, chemical substances that have a long
half-life in the environment and can be harmful to human health and/or the environment—
could further aggravate the impact of pandemics.  Air pollution has an adverse effect
on global disease burden,  and it has been identified as the fifth-largest mortality risk
factor worldwide, representing 7.6% of all-cause mortality [
254].  The use of pesticides
and agricultural or industrial chemicals together with exposure to hazardous waste (e.g.,
electronic waste) is increasing, together with the spectrum of adverse effects on human
health [255,256]. A special situation exists for the so-calledxenobiotics. These are chemical
substances found within an organism that are not naturally produced (or expected to
be present) within the organism in question.  An example is bisphenol A, a ubiquitous
plasticizing agent found in food, beverage cans, and thermal receipt paper. Xenobiotics
represent a stress factor for immune cells and can cause inflammation [
257].   Tobacco
72

Nutrients2022,14,24
smoking, which will be discussed in a later section, is another source of xenobiotics that
has been associated with a variety of deleterious effects on human health [258].
Long-term exposure to air pollution leads to the overexpression of ACE2, thereby fa-
cilitating viral penetration and subsequent depletion of ACE2 and increasing the likelihood
of poor outcomes of COVID-19 [259].  Exposure to air pollution may also influence the
systemic inflammatory response [260], the alveolar macrophage-mediated inflammatory
response to phagocytize the virus [261], and affect host immunity [262].  There is meta-
analytical evidence suggesting that exposure to ambient pollutants is associated with an
increased level of CRP. On the other hand, ambient pollutants can increase Th2 immune
responses, which is a characteristic in the respiratory tract during severe virus-induced exac-
erbations [263], such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The decreased
immune response caused by air pollution could also affect vaccination efficacy. Exposure to
metals such as mercury has been associated with a lower immune response to vaccination
programs including hepatitis B, influenza, measles, pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria in
children [138]. However, further studies are needed to corroborate this association.
The bulk of evidence suggests that exposure to air pollution might increase the risk
of respiratory infections and, consequently, contribute to a worse prognosis of COVID-
19. While the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a large drop in pollution levels [
264],
exposure to air pollution may increase the odds of COVID-19 infection [
259,265] as well
as symptoms severity [
259,266] and risk of death [259,267,268].  In terms of COVID-19
mortality, of the 4443 fatality cases recorded in 66 administrative regions from Italy, Spain,
France, and Germany, a vast majority (83%) of COVID-19 fatalities occurred in the regions
with the highest nitrogen dioxide levels [268].  Coronavirus is in the air [269], and ultra-
violet reduction as a consequence of air pollution may promote viral persistence in the
air [270]. Exposure to toxic metals such as arsenic, lead, cadmium, or mercury is associated
with respiratory dysfunction and respiratory diseases (i.e., chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and bronchitis), and hence a link between metal exposure and COVID-19 risk
and/or severity might exist [271].
Therefore, it seems therefore reasonable to promote interventions aimed at reducing
pollution levels.
9. Smoking
Approximately 1.3 billion people smoke worldwide [272]. Despite the anti-smoking
public health policies implemented over the last 50 years, tobacco smoking remains a
leading global risk factor [
258].  Smoking history decreases life expectancy by at least a
decade compared to those who have never smoked [273]. In fact, the smoke we inhale from
tobacco contains more than 60 carcinogens [274].
There is accumulating evidence that like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the cell
membrane receptor ACE2 [275] as the main entry point into target cells. One of the main
constituents of cigarette smoke, nicotine, might be able to downregulate the expression
or activity of ACE2 receptors [
276].  It could be thus hypothesized that inhaled nicotine
during smoking has a protective effect against COVID-19.  A recently published report,
however, found that pulmonary ACE2 receptors are more activated in smokers than in
never smokers [277], indicating that smoking is potentially a risk factor for COVID-19 by
modulating ACE2 expression.
Smoking is also a potential risk factor for COVID-19 because of its detrimental ef-
fects on lung function and the possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by finger–mouth
contact during tobacco use.  However, initially, there was controversy regarding the re-
lationship between smoking and SARS-CoV-2 infection/disease severity [
278–281], and
there were conflicting hypotheses on the role of nicotine on immune function [12]. Some
studies have suggested that nicotine has anti-inflammatory effects [282,283] that could
be beneficial in attenuating the cytokine storm often produced in response to viral in-
fection [
281,284,285].  There is indeed some evidence supporting a therapeutic role for
nicotine in patients with severe COVID-19 [
284,285], which is consistent, at least partly,
73

Nutrients2022,14,24
with the notion that, to some extent, COVID-19 might be a disease of the nicotinic choliner-
gic system [281]. However, meta-analytical evidence indicates that smoking worsens the
prognosis of COVID-19 [286–289].
It should also be considered that cigarette smoking and vaping can weaken immune
health and increase the risk of infection and outcomes [290–292], potentially making smok-
ers more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 and future viruses.  For instance, influenza risk is
several-fold higher (and the clinical presentation of the disease is much more severe) in
smokers than non-smokers [291]. On the other hand, the number and activity of NK cells
are decreased in smokers [293–295]. In addition, higher production of the proinflammatory
cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-αtogether with an enhanced proliferative response to
mitogens has been reported in smokers compared to non-smokers [
295]. The molecular
pathways by which tobacco exerts deleterious effects on the immune system would involve
NF
κB, mitogen-activated protein (commonly known as ‘MAP’) kinases signaling as well as
histone modification [296]. Of note, the high level of toxic metals in tobacco smoke may
also partly underlie the association between smoking and COVID-19 severity due to their
role in the development of respiratory dysfunction, immunotoxicity, and severity of viral
diseases [271].
There is meta-analytical evidence that smokers have a 1.53 higher risk of nonresponse
to vaccines such as hepatitis B compared to non-smokers [71].  This impaired response
to vaccination might be mediated by the proinflammatory status associated with smok-
ing [
297].  Another potential mechanism has been postulated in a study with a murine
model showing that the impaired response to vaccines may be mediated by cigarette smoke-
related inhibition of the pulmonary T-cell response to vaccination against influenza virus
andMycobacterium tuberculosis[298].
Further research is warranted when keeping in mind that there is also preclinical
evidence suggesting that smoking could be protective against the infection and severity
of COVID-19 [278–281]. However, in light of the multiple well-established adverse effects
of smoking on human health and the lack of evidence on whether an eventual association
between smoking and protection against COVID-19 reflects an actual causal effect, public
health programs should continue to support smoking cessation.
10. Gut Microbiome
The gastrointestinal tract is inhabited by about 100 trillion microbes (ormicrobiota)[299],
including mainly bacteria, collectively known as themicrobiome, that regulate fundamental
functions that preserve human health, including host nutrient metabolism, xenobiotic
and drug metabolism, or maintenance of structural integrity of the gut mucosal barrier
2
.
The gut microbiome also plays a pivotal role in immune tolerance, inflammation, and
protection against pathogens [
300].  In fact, the microbiome has an important effect on
the training and development of major components of the host’s innate and adaptive
immune system [
300].  Alterations of the gut microbiome (known as dysbiosis) might
lead to dysregulated immune responses to commensal microbes and the stabilization of a
proinflammatory community of microbes, hence contributing to LGCI [301]. Accordingly,
dysbiosis is associated with a wide variety of conditions including obesity [302], type
2 diabetes [
302], hypertension [303], colon cancer [304], autoimmune diseases (such as
inflammatory bowel disease [305]), allergic asthma [306], and human immunodeficiency
virus [307].
Although the gut microbiome is a part of the exposome, several of the aforemen-
tioned exposome factors can influence the status of the gut microbiome and lead to dys-
biosis [
108,308], reflecting the bidirectional and dynamic relationship between different
components of the exposome, as well as the host.  The inappropriate use of antibiotics
and other medications (e.g., proton pump inhibitors, antipsychotics, opioids, and nons-
teroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) has a notable impact on the overall architecture of the
gut microbiome [309,310]. Other factors shown to influence the composition and function
of the gut microbiome include physical exercise [311], psychosocial stress [312], tobacco
74

Nutrients2022,14,24
and alcohol use [313,314], and, as mentioned before, diet [107,108].  For instance, a high-
sodium intake can alter the composition of the gut microbiome [
96], and this has been
associated with increased and decreased pro- and anti-inflammatory activity, respectively,
of CD4+ T cells and macrophages [96].  Likewise, a high-fat/low-fiber westernised diet
is linked to a decrease in microbial diversity and species richness, with a low abundance
of some beneficial species (such asBifidobacterium,LactobacilliumorEubacterium), whereas
a Mediterranean diet has essentially the opposite effect [315].  On the other hand, pro-
biotics, live microorganisms with purported health benefits for the host if consumed in
adequate amounts, and microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (commonly abbreviated by
‘MACs’ and also known as prebiotics—carbohydrates that are resistant to digestion and
are made available for gut microbiota to ferment or metabolize into beneficial compounds,
such as short chain fatty acids) could favourably modulate the gut microbiota, thereby
exerting immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects [107,108,316,317]. Accordingly,
low-fat yogurt, a fermented dairy product containing a variety of probiotic bacteria, is
associated with a reduction in markers of chronic inflammation and abdominal obesity in
interventional and observational studies [318–320]. On the other hand, paradoxically, the
hygiene measures proposed to prevent COVID-19, such as hand washing, could alter the
composition of the gut microbiome. According to the ‘hygiene hypothesis’, which proposes
that exposure to germs and certain infections helps the development of the immune system,
excessive hygiene measures could negatively affect the microbiome [321].
Therefore, based on the influence of the microbiome on immunity, and the existence of
a crosstalk between the gut microbiota and the lungs, known as the gut–lung axis [
322,323],
it might be argued that a healthy gut microbiome could play an important role in prevent-
ing respiratory infections or at least attenuating their severity. Indeed, the microbiota has
previously been shown to regulate immune defence against influenza virus infection in
the respiratory tract [
324].  More recently, some authors have suggested the existence of
dysbiosis in COVID-19 patients [
325,326].  Zuo et al. [325] found an inverse correlation
between the abundance of the gut speciesFaecalibacterium prausnitzii(an anti-inflammatory
bacterium) and disease severity. Yeoh et al. concluded that the gut microbiome is implicated
in the magnitude of COVID-19 severity, possibly through the modulation of host immune
responses [327]. These authors also found that even 30 days after disease resolution, gut
microbiome composition was still altered,  which could contribute to persistent symp-
toms [327]. In addition, there is evidence for an increased incidence of dysbiosis in critically
ill patients, a phenomenon associated with sepsis, organ failure, and death [328,329].
A recent systematic network and meta-analysis analysed the potential antiviral mech-
anisms of probiotics [330]. The authors found that probiotics could affect ACE2-mediated
virus entry and temper the pro-inflammatory status caused by activation of nucleotide-
binding oligomerization domain (NOD), leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing proteins
(NLR) P3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, withNLRP3inflammasome being a multimeric pro-
tein complex that initiates an inflammatory form of cell death and triggers the release of
proinflammatory cytokines IL-1βand IL-18 [331]. Probiotics can also improve the systemic
immune response to viral infection (thereby attenuating the resulting lung tissue dam-
age and cardiovascular complications) and modulate glucose/lipid metabolic pathways
affected by the infection [330]. These findings might suggest that probiotics could be con-
sidered a potential preventive and alternative treatment strategy for both mild and severe
stages of COVID-19 [330], although the evidence is still limited.
The gut microbiome could also affect the immune response to vaccination [332,333].
There is reasonable evidence that the gut microbiome improves both B cell and T cell
responses to vaccination [334]. Of note, vaccine responses can vary widely between people
in a given region [335].   A possible explanation is the high variability in the types of
gut microbiota between populations [334]. For example, a study conducted in Ghanaian
children concluded that the gut microbiome composition, which correlates significantly
with rotavirus vaccine immunogenicity, might contribute to the diminished efficacy of
rotavirus vaccines reported in developing countries [
336].  Another study analysed the
75

Nutrients2022,14,24
influence of gut microbiome on mucosal IgA antibody response to the polio vaccine in
a population of Chinese infants [
337].  The authors found that the composition of the
gut microbiome was significantly different, reporting a higher and lower abundance of
FirmicutesandActinobacteria,  respectively,  in  IgA-negative  children  than  in  their  IgA-
positive peers [337]. On the other hand, antibiotic administration in individuals with low
levels of pre-existing immunity impairs responses to a seasonal influenza vaccine [338].
Conversely,  a recent systematic review on the role of probiotics on vaccine responses
suggested that probiotics represent a relatively cheap intervention to improve vaccine
efficacy and duration of protection [339].
Keeping a healthy gut microbiome represents an important first-line defence against
pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, regardless of their virulence. As for the potential impact
of the gut microbiome in modulating vaccine immunogenicity, further work in different
human populations is needed.
11. Limitations and Perspectives
This review has some methodological limitations that should be considered.  First,
its narrative nature is likely to induce some bias, as it lacks strict criteria for the inclu-
sion/exclusion of studies. In addition, the overwhelming number of new studies published
virtually every day on the COVID-19 pandemic implies that previous conclusions on a
given area are frequently challenged and must be revisited,  with new hypotheses fre-
quently arising.  In this regard, we finished writing the first draft of this review on 17
July 2021, and therefore, at the time this review is published, evidence might have been
updated on certain topics.  On the other hand, although exposome improvements seem
to be a potentially effective strategy to deal with COVID-19, a vast amount of research
still needs to be implemented not only to shed light on the effects of combining a healthy
lifestyle with environmental exposure but also to disentangle potential pathophysiological
underpinnings. After reviewing the current literature, we have provided practical, testable
hypotheses for future research in the field.
12. Conclusions
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, a variety of lifestyle and environmental ex-
posures, collectively referred to as the exposome, that are known to play a major role in
immune health, have been worsened. Notably, these include an increased prevalence of
physical inactivity and obesity, unhealthy dietary patterns, high levels of psychosocial
stress, sleep deprivation and circadian disruption, as well as high exposure to air pollution,
low sun exposure, and insufficient vitamin D levels (Figure3).  The need to implement
‘traditional’ measures aimed at avoiding viral transmission (e.g., home confinement, closure
of parks and gyms) should not overshadow the deleterious effects that they can have on
other health markers.  As a society, we should be prepared for a potential recurrence of
previous pandemias and the emergence of new ones, and this preparedness should start
with the promotion of healthy lifestyles and environmental exposures.

Abstract:
Background: Beach handball is a recent team sport characterized by defensive and offensive
actions on a sand surface. Scientific evidence has shown that body composition is fundamental in
sports performance. The main objective of this study was to know the body composition, anthropo-
metric characteristics, and bone mineral density of elite beach handball players. Furthermore, another
purpose was to analyze the differences between categories (junior and senior) and playing position.
Methods:A descriptive, cross-sectional study of 36 male players (18 juniors and 18 seniors) of the
Spanish National Beach Handball Team was conducted. Full profile anthropometry and calcaneal
ultrasound measurements were used.Results: Significant differences between categories (p< 0.05)
were found in: height, body mass, arm span, BMI, muscle mass, fat mass, bone mass, skinfolds, and
body perimeters. The somatotype changes depending on the playing position. Bone mineral density
of the players was adequate. No significant differences were found by playing position.Conclusions:
Senior players had a better body composition due to the presence of less fat mass than junior players.
This study provides reference values of elite junior and senior beach handball players and by playing
positions. This data is useful for the identification of talents and players who should be trained to
improve their body composition.

1. Introduction
Beach handball (BH) is a sport that derives from indoor handball. This specialty be-
came popular in Italy in the 1990s, however, it was not until the last ten years that it became
a global sport [1]. BH players play on an unstable surface such as sand, which means an
increase in energy expenditure and neuromuscular needs compared to indoor handball [2].
In beach handball there are various actions such as throwing, passing, jumping, blocking,
running, etc. that make it an intermittent high intensity contact sport [3,4]. The different
playing positions are goalkeepers, wings, specialist, pivots, and defenders [5,6].
In recent years, research has begun on this sport, finding that the main variables
affecting performance are morphology, body composition and, physical and physiological
characteristics [2,5,7–12]. This is because BH is a sport with defensive and offensive actions
of great speed to achieve the ultimate objective of scoring a goal [13].
The specific characteristics of beach handball are frequent changes in intensity, specific
skills and social factors. These aspects define the determinants of coordination, endurance,

strength and cognition in this sport [14,15].   To achieve optimal performance,  actions
must be performed with maximum intensity [16,17]. In BH players, groupings are made
by date of birth, dividing them into juniors and seniors [16].  Therefore, depending on
the age category, body composition and technical abilities differ, influencing success and
development as a player [16,18].
As mentioned above,  numerous studies have shown that body composition and
anthropometric measurements are determinant in youth and senior handball players, both
in indoor and beach handball [16,18–20]. Many research studies have shown that optimal
body composition in athletes is associated with improvements in physical performance
(aerobic and anaerobic) and muscle strength [
21–26].  For optimal performance of BH
players, it is necessary that their weight and fat percentage are within the recommended
parameters for their age group, position, and sex [6,9].
Anthropometric characteristics have been shown to be decisive in indoor handball
in junior and senior teams [
16,18,20,27].  In addition, a direct influence between body
composition and performance tests has been observed [6,28]. Milanese et al. [29] evaluated
body composition as a function of playing position and found some significant differences
between players. Body mass index (BMI) and indirect estimates of fat mass were commonly
used to analyze body composition [16].  However, these methods have been discarded
due to their limitations, as BMI is not only related to fat mass, but also to lean mass [
30].
Therefore, in recent years, higher-quality investigations use methods such as dual X-ray
densitometry (DXA) and full anthropometry [30].
Whole body composition as a whole includes body size and the proportion of body
compartments. Body composition is usually analyzed through anthropometric measure-
ment of weight, skinfolds, circumferences, diameters, heights and BMI [31]. Body size is
of great importance for throwing in attack or blocking in defense, achieving higher ball
velocity in jump throwing also having a strong positive effect on throwing performance
and isometric strength [14,32]. The presence of a high percentage of fat is associated with
multiple diseases and inflammation, so it has negative health consequences [6]. The opti-
mal composition of athletes is framed by small amounts of fat mass and high amounts of
muscle mass [33,34]. The specific percentage for adequate performance depends on the
sporting position [33,35,36].
Forward players have displayed more favorable body composition results than other
playing positions in indoor handball [37]. The morphology and composition of the upper
limbs are fundamental aspects in beach handball. The best elite indoor handball players
have shown higher values for humerus amplitude and hand length and width, these traits
are found in the upper extremities and cannot be modified by training [38].
Therefore, it can be seen how the assessment of body composition is a fundamental
aspect in sport due to its relation with performance and injury prevention, highlighting
the importance of fat and muscle mass content [
39,40].  It has been shown that fat mass,
as opposed to muscle mass, is dead weight for jumping and sprinting, actions frequently
performed in BH [39,41].
Bone mass is another relevant component to consider. The assessment of bone mineral
density (BMD) is a measure that informs us about bone condition and strength. BMD is
inversely related to the occurrence of fractures [42]. Skeletal injuries are rare in athletes, but
their occurrence can have serious consequences for the athlete’s health and professional
life [43].  Physical exercise plays an important role in bone mass during growth.  Beach
handball is a sport that involves high mechanical stress on the lower limbs due to high
intensity running, jumping and landing, causes osteogenic reactions [42,44].
Despite the increase of research in this sport in recent years, data about physical
characteristics and bone mineral density in elite BH players are scarce [
9].  Knowledge
of the  anthropometric profiles of these  players is  necessary to be  able to identify  the
most  important  aspects  which  will  have  to  be  improved  in  order  to  achieve  optimal
sport performance.

The main objective of this research was to describe the body composition of elite
male junior and senior BH players.  The specific objectives were:  (a) to know the body
composition and bone  mineral density of  elite  BH  players  by  categories  and  playing
position (b) to analyze the differences in body composition according to categories. The
initial hypothesis was that body composition would be different between youth and senior
players; and that the players with the best body composition would be the forwards.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design
A descriptive, cross-sectional study was used to analyze the body composition and
bone mineral density of male beach handball players, measured by anthropometry and
calcaneal ultrasound, respectively.  The research was conducted in accordance with the
ethical standards recognized by the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by
the Ethical Committee of Alicante University (UA-2019-04-09).
2.2. Subjects
The study sample consisted of 36 male beach handball players (18 junior;16.7±0.46 years
and 18 seniors; 25.0±5.19 years). All of them were professional players of the National
Beach Handball Team of the Royal Spanish Handball Federation, therefore, they represent
the elite of BH players. The sample is divided into goalkeepers, wings, specialists, pivots,
and defenders. All players received information about the objectives of the research, the
experimental protocol, and the study procedures.  Each of the participants signed the
informed consent document. In the case of underage players, parents or legal tutors gave
permission. Anonymity was preserved for all participants.
2.3. Anthropometric Data
Anthropometric variables were measured for each subject.  For this purpose, full
profile was developed, following the standard protocol of the International Society for the
Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK) [45].
All measurements were performed by the same investigator, an ISAK level 2 anthro-
pometrist.  The mean technical error was less than 1% for perimeters, circumferences,
lengths, and heights and less than 5% for skinfolds. All measurements were performed on
the first day of the concentration, under basal conditions, in the same location and at room
temperature (22±1
◦
C).
The following anthropometric material was used as approved and previously cal-
ibrated:  wall  measuring  rod  (accuracy,  1  mm);  digital  scale  (BC545N,  Tanita,  Tokyo,
Japan;  accuracy, 100 g);  metallic, narrow, and an inextensible measuring tape (Lufkin,
TX, USA; accuracy, 1 mm); small bone diameter pachymeter (Smartmet, Jalisco, Mexico;
accuracy, 1 mm); skinfold caliper (Harpenden, UK; accuracy, 0.2 mm), complementary
material (demographic pencil to mark the players) and anthropometric bench measuring
40×50×30 cm.
Height and seated height were determined using a mobile anthropometer (Seca 213,
SECA Deutschland, Hamburg, Germany) to the nearest millimeter, with the participant’s
head maintained in the Frankfort Horizontal Plane position. The length of wingspan was
measured with an arm span meter (Smartmec, Zapopan Jalisco, México), made with a steel
tape 5 m long and 18 mm wide, with an accuracy of 1 mm. Eight skinfolds were collected
(subscapular, tricipital, bicipital, iliac crest, supraspinal, abdominal, anterior thigh and
medial calf); 13 perimeters (head, neck, thorax, relaxed arm, contracted arm, forearm, wrist,
waist, hip, thigh 1 cm from the glute, medial thigh, maximum leg and minimum ankle);
9 bone diameters (biacromial, anteroposterior abdominal, biliocrestal, transverse thorax, an-
teroposterior thorax, biepicondylar humerus, bi-styloid and bicondylar femur, bimalleolar);
8 lengths and heights (foot length, acromiale-radiale, radiale- stylion, midstylion-dactylion,
iliospinale height, trochanterion height, trochanterion-tibiale laterale, tibiale laterale height,
93

Nutrients2021,13, 1817
tibiale medial-sphyrion tibiale). The sum of 6 skinfolds was also computed (subscapular,
triceps, supraspinale, abdominal, front thigh and medial calf).
Body composition was calculated using the following models: fat mass was estimated
using the methods of Withers et al. [46] and Faulkner [47]. Muscle and bone masses were
determined using the methods of Lee et al. [48] and Rocha [49], respectively. According to
the Spanish Committee of Kinanthropometry, these methods are the most suitable for high
performance players [49].
2.4. Somatotype
The mean somatotype and classification were determined using the anthropometric
method of Heath and Carter [50] and its classification [51]. The somatotype is defined as
the quantification of the shape and composition of the human body. It is represented by
three components: (1) endomorphy (2) mesomorphy and (3) ectomorphy. Each component
was calculated with its corresponding formulas [52].
2.5. Anthropometric Dimensions—Proportionality
Proportionality analysis were performed using the Phantom stratagem; a bilaterally
symmetrical, bilaterally symmetrical, conceptually modeled, reference human derived
from male and female reference data, proposed and revised by Ross and Ward [53]. Each
variable was adjusted to the Phantom size using z-score = (1/s)×v×[(170.18/h)
d
−p];
where z = proportionality value, v = size of any given variable, 170.18 = Phantom stature
constant, h = subject’s stature, d = dimensional exponent, P = Phantom value for variable v,
and s = Phantom standard deviation value for variable based on an hypothetical universal
human population. The z-values have a mean of 0, so a z-value of 0.0 indicates that the
variable v is proportionally equal to that of the Phantom; a z-value greater than 0.0 means
that the subject is proportionally greater than the Phantom for the variable v; otherwise, a
z-value less than 0.0 shows that the subject is proportionally less than the Phantom for that
variable [53].
2.6. Bone Quality
A heel ultrasound densitometer (Achilles EXP II, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA)
was used to measure the bilateral calcaneus of each subject. Quality assurance was per-
formed before the first measurement, by calibrating the device on a dedicated phantom
supplied by the manufacturer. In addition, to ensure good contact, an ultrasound gel was
applied. Broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) and speed of sound (SOS) were directly
measured during each ultrasonographic evaluation.  The calcaneal stiffness index was
calculated using the following formula, previously used in other studies [54]:
Calcaneal stiffness (A.U.) = (0.67
−BUA + 0.28−SOS)−420
The elastic resistance of the bone is measured by the variable SOS, while the loss
of ultrasound energy that occurs by absorption or scattering (and correlates with bone
density) is evaluated by the variable BUA. By a combination of SOS and BUA, stiffness
is achieved.
2.7. Statistical Analyses
To show the characteristics of the participants, descriptive statistics were made for all
variables (Mean±SD). To test the normality of the sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Shapiro-
Wilk and Levene’s test were applied.  Analysis of variance (ANOVA), with Bonferroni
post hoc comparisons to identify differences in basic anthropometric and demographic
characteristics between players. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the correction of
Bonferroni was used to compare differences between age groups (junior vs. senior), only the
variables related to body composition were adjusted by BMI. The Somatotype Attitudinal
Distance (SAD) was used to compare somatotype group means of junior and senior players.
Statistical significance was set atp< 0.05. Cohen’s d was used as a measure of the effect
94

Nutrients2021,13, 1817
size (ES) of the differences between junior and senior players. The thresholds stipulated
by Cohen [55] were considered; small (d = 0.2), moderate (d = 0.6), large (d = 1.2), very
large (d = 2.0) and extremely large (d = 4.0). Mean differences in the chosen anthropometric
characteristics, body composition and somatotype components of the players between
playing positions were tested using a general linear model with a Tukey’s post hoc test
(p< 0.05) and using BMI as a covariate. All statistical analysis were performed using the
Jamovi 1.1.3.0 software (The jamovi project, Sydney, Australia). The z-phantom scores were
obtained from Excel and were represented in graphic form.
3. Results
A total of 32 male beach handball players participated in this study:  50% juniors
and 50% seniors.  Table1shows the basic anthropometric measurements.  Mean weight
is
78.1±12.2 kgand  90.1±13.4  kg  for  juniors  and  seniors,  respectively.   Height  is
181±5.90 cmfor juniors and 188±7.73 cm for seniors.   Senior players show higher
values, presenting significant differences (p< 0.05) in all variables, including arm span,
which is 184±7.45 cm for junior and 193±9.35 cm for senior. In addition, generally the
effect sizes were moderate to high. Due to these differences, BMI will be used as a covariate
to analyze all the differences in the rest of the variables analyzed.

Figure 2.Somatotype distribution of elite male senior beach handball players.
However, if somatotype is analyzed as a function of playing position, as shown in the
figure, the trends are different. For juniors, goalkeepers present a balanced endomorph
somatotype, while right and left wings and defenders are mesomorph-ectomorph. In the
senior category, defenders and right wings have a mesomorphic-endomorphic somatotype,
while specialists and left wings tend to have a mesomorphic-ectomorphic somatotype.
Table5There are significant differences in some skinfolds such as triceps (p< 0.01),
biceps (p< 0.05), front thigh (p< 0.05) and medial calf (p< 0.01), as well as in the sum
of 6 skinfolds (p< 0.05).  There was a general tendency for senior players to have lower
skinfold values. Overall effect sizes were moderate to large.

Results shows that there has been a slight difference in some of the variables analyzed
between juniors and seniors. The comparison between goalkeepers and specialists gave
values ofp= 0.076 and ES = 1.57, between goalkeepers and pivots ofp= 0.067 andES = 1.68;
therefore, the ES in both cases were high. For the Stiffness variable, between the goalkeepers
and the wings the values were,p= 0.057 and ES = 1.64, so there were also differences.
Figure3shows the anthropometric dimensions, as proportionality profiles of the junior
and senior players. Goalkeepers have been excluded due to the particularity of their playing
position. After analysis, significant differences were observed in some variables such as
Z skinfold calf (p= 0.032; ES = 0.744; MD = 0.661), Z relaxed arm (
p= 0.041; ES =−0.704;

4. Discussion
The aim of this research was to analyse the anthropometric profile, body composi-
tion and somatotype of elite BH players according to category (junior vs.  senior) and
playing positions. The results showed significant differences between junior and senior
categories in several components such as kg of muscle mass, kg of fat mass and kg of
bone mass, as well as skinfolds (triceps, biceps, thigh, calf and sum of six skinfolds) and
perimeters (arm, contracted arm and waist). However, no differences in body composition
and anthropometric profile by playing position have been found.  Other studies have
investigated body composition in Spanish senior elite BH players [
9,12].  However, the
study by
Zapardiel et al. [12]only analysed weight, height and BMI. On the other hand,
99

Nutrients2021,13, 1817
Pueo et al. [9] did study the anthropometric profile and somatotype, but the study was of
doubtful reliability due to the small sample size used. Another of identified weaknesses in
this study is the grouping of players according to playing position: goalkeepers, front play-
ers and back players; categorising wings-specialists and pivots-defenders as the same, an
aspect that undermines the principle of specificity in training. In the present research, each
specific position has been studied individually: goalkeepers, wings, specialists, pivots, and
defenders. So far, no studies have been conducted to examine the anthropometric, BMD
and somatotype characteristics of elite junior BH players. One strength of this scientific
paper is that it provides a frame of reference for junior elite BH players.
The junior elite BH players showed a mean height of 181±5.90 cm and a body mass of
78.1
±12.2 kg, while the seniors had a height of 188±7.73 cm and weight of90.1±13.4 kg.
The differences found are due to the different stages of development of the junior vs. senior
players. These results are slightly higher than the ones obtained in similar studies for senior
players where the mean height results were: 187.4
±8.2 cm [9] and 187.5±7.5 cm [12]; and
mean weights of: 85.2±11.3 kg [9] and 87.0±9.5 kg [12]. Thus, according to the results
of the present study, senior BH players are moderately taller and heavier than the players
analysed in other studies.  Consequently, the BMI presented in the senior players of the
study (25.4±2.50 kg/m
2
), is higher than those presented in the studies of Pueo et al. [9]
and Zapardiel et al. [12] being 24.2±2.5 kg/m
2
and 24.9 kg/m
2
, respectively.
The body composition of the players studied showed significant differences in muscle
mass (kg),  fat mass,  measured with Wither’s formula (kg),  and bone mass (kg).  This
distinction can be explained by the significant difference between juniors and seniors in
total body mass. The juniors showed a muscle mass of 42.5±3.45%, while the seniors had
a percentage of 42.8±4.03%. The data was similar to the one obtained from the research
carried out by Pueo et al. [9] in which the muscle mass results were 42.7±2.6%.
Regarding fat mass, both studies used the Withers formula for its calculation and
for this reason, they are comparable. The present study obtained a fat mass in juniors of
13.8±6.73%and in seniors of 13.1±5.03%. The senior players who participated in the
study by Pueo et al. showed a fat percentage of 11.7±3.9% [9]. These results were lower
than those presented by the players in our study, possibly due to the fact that the players
were in better physical shape, also because the data collection could take place at a different
time of the season. Comparing these results with the indoor modality [56], players playing
on court have lower values of fat mass (11.3±2.4%) than those of the present study and
other BH studies [9].
Significant differences were found between juniors and seniors in skinfolds.  The
sum of 6 skinfolds presented by the juniors was 71.9
±34.8 mm, while for seniors was
69.1±27.3 mm.  These results coincided with the data obtained for fat mass and were
similar to the results of other studies such as Pueo et al. [9]; 62.9±24.1 mm. The present
data was lower than those found in elite indoor handball players (77.2±27.5 mm) [57].
Therefore, it can be concluded that skinfold measurements in indoor handball are higher,
i.e., with more subcutaneous fat, than in BH [9].
Regarding bone mass and BMD, the junior players had 15.5±1.34% bone mass and
BUA, SOS and Stiffness values of 131±10.3 dB/MHz, 1640±33 m/s and127±14.5 (A.U),
respectively. On the other hand, senior players obtained a bone mass of 14.9±1.07% and
BUA, SOS and Stiffness of 131±9.24 dB/MHz, 1657±33.1 m/s and133±11.9 (A.U).
Pueo et al. [9]obtained similar results in senior BH players 15.7±1.6%, however, they did
not analyse BMD, so BUA, SOS andStiffness results cannot be compared with other BH
players due to the lack of studies. Studies conducted in Spanish senior population yield lower
results in BUA than those presented in the current research (93.42±18.38 dB/MHz)[58]
and (84.5
±18.4 dB/MHz) [59].   The results found for SOS were also lower than the
ones showed on the paper (1567.5
±33.3 m/s) [59].  In regard to BMD assessment in
juniors, other populations have obtained a BUA of 89.46±14.41 dB/MHz and an SOS of
1503.54±13.45 m/s[60]. These differences from the results of the present investigation
are due to the fact that exercise is associated with an increase in bone mineral density [61].

Nutrients2021,13, 1817
The junior and senior elite BH players presented a balanced mesomorphic somato-
type (2.79-3.40-2.91 and 2.69-3.73-2.70, respectively). These results were similar to those
presented in the study by Pueo et al. [
9], although the mesomorphy value was lower
(2.6-4.4-2.7).
In respect of variations in anthropometric profile and body composition between play-
ing positions, the present study found no significant differences except in SOS. However,
Pueo et al. [9] found variations to be considered in height, weight and wingspan, but not in
the rest of the components. These differences can be explained by the small sample size
analysed in the Pueo et al. [9] research.
The body proportionality profiles of the BH players were similar to each other, al-
though the junior players showed lower results. Significant differences were found in calf
skinfold, flexed arm, forearm, thorax and waist circumferences. To the authors’ knowledge,
this is the first study to assess proportionality in beach handball players, so comparisons
with other similar studies cannot be made.  This research will be useful to confirm the
proportionality values through further studies.
The present study was not exempt from limitations, one of the limitations may be
that both body composition and BMD values were studied with full anthropometry and
calcaneal ultrasound due to the feasibility of the research. Another limitation that should
make the results between playing positions to be interpreted with caution, is that there
were not the same number of players in the different categories.  Future investigations
should be carried out on a sufficient and equal number of players per playing position and
with gold standard instruments such as DXA. Furthermore, these data refer to Caucasian
players, so for other populations these data should be interpreted with caution.
However, considering the above limitations, the results of this research are of great
relevance since they incorporate junior category data, so far not studied in BH, and also
provide more complete information and a larger number of samples than previous research
carried out in BH players [9,12].  These data should be useful for the recruitment and
selection of players with the optimum profile for performance in beach handball and the
detection of talent in young players.
5. Conclusions
The anthropometric profile, as well as body composition and somatotype, play a
fundamental role in the optimal performance of elite BH players. This research examined
the differences in male BH players by categories (junior vs. senior) and by playing positions
(goalkeepers, wings, specialists, pivots, and defenders).
Differences between age groups were found in height, body mass, arm span, BMI,
muscle mass, fat mass, bone mass, skinfolds, and body perimeters. Body composition was
more optimal in senior players due to the presence of less fat mass. The mean somatotype
of both categories was mesomorph balanced.  No significant differences were found in
anthropometric and body characteristics according to playing position.
The data provided by this study is considered of great interest to compare and obtain a
reference for elite BH players. Future research should focus on analyzing these parameters
on a larger number of players per playing position and to achieve decisive references using
more precise body estimation methods such as DXA.

Abstract:Introduction: Recent original research and meta-analyses suggest that acute caffeine sup-
plementation improves exercise performance in team-sport athletes (TSA). Nonetheless, most of
the studies testing the effects of caffeine on TSA included samples of male athletes, and there is no
meta-analysis of the performance-enhancing effects of caffeine on female TSA. The aim of the present
study was to synthesize the existing literature regarding the effect of caffeine supplementation on
physical performance in adult female TSA. Methods: A search was performed in Pubmed/Medline,
SPORTDiscus and Scopus. The search was performed from the inception of indexing until 1 Septem-
ber 2021. Crossover randomized controlled trials (RCT) assessing the effects of oral caffeine intake
on several aspects of performance in female TSA were selected.  The methodological quality and
risk of bias were assessed for individual studies using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale
(PEDro) and the RoB 2 tool. A random-effects meta-analysis of standardized mean differences (SMD)
was performed for several performance variables.  Results:  The search retrieved 18 articles that
fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Overall, most of the studies were of excellent quality with a
low risk of bias. The meta-analysis results showed that caffeine increased performance in specific
team-sport skills (SMD: 0.384, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.077–0.691), countermovement jump
(SMD: 0.208, CI: 0.079–0.337), total body impacts (SMD: 0.488; 95% CI: 0.050, 0.927) and handgrip
strength (SMD: 0.395, CI: 0.126–0.665). No effects were found on the ratings of perceived exertion,
squat jumps, agility, repeated sprint ability or agility tests performed after fatigue.  Conclusions:
The results of the meta-analysis revealed that acute caffeine intake was effective in increasing some
aspects of team-sports performance in women athletes.  Hence, caffeine could be considered as a
supplementation strategy for female athletes competing in team sports.

1. Introduction
The use of caffeine in sporting events was controlled until 1 January 2004, since a
post-competition urinary concentration above 12 micrograms per milliliter was considered
an adverse analytical finding by the World Anti-Doping Agency [
1]. However, at that date,
caffeine was removed from the list of prohibited substances in the monitoring program
of the World Anti-Doping Agency [2]. The removal of caffeine from the list of prohibited
substances, in addition to increasing scientific knowledge about the potential ergogenic
effects of caffeine, has caused an increase in caffeine intake in both men and women athletes
over recent years [3].
The widespread use of this supplement in sport is based on scientific evidence, as
it has been classified by the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) as a “Strong
evidence to support efficacy and apparently safe” supplement [
4], with recommended doses
ranging from 3 to 6 mg per kg of body mass with a timing of ingestion of 1 h before exercise.
A vast amount of research indicates that caffeine intake can have a positive effect on several
forms of athletic performance [5,6]. Grgic and colleagues performed an umbrella review
in 2019 including 21 published meta-analyses, revealing that caffeine supplementation
elicited an ergogenic effect on muscle endurance and strength, anaerobic power and aerobic
endurance, which are critical variables for team-sports performance [5].
In team-sport athletes (TSA), the efficacy of caffeine supplementation in enhancing
performance is less clear than in other sport disciplines,  because success is explained
by a combination of physical, technical and tactical skills.  Brown et al.  suggested via
a meta-analysis that caffeine had no effect on repeated sprint ability (RSA) in TSA [
7].
These results were contradicted by a review performed by Chia et al. [
8],  who found
improvements in sprint performance (in 8 out of 10 studies) and vertical jump (in 7 out of
8 studies) in ball game athletes. These findings were reaffirmed by a later meta-analysis
developed by Salinero et al. [9] evaluating TSA and also by a systematic review developed
by Mielgo-Ayuso et al. [10] focusing on soccer players. Both studies concluded that acute
caffeine ingestion improved jump height and RSA [9,10] in addition to agility performance,
total running distance and number of performed sprints during a match [9]. Nonetheless,
Ferreira and colleagues [11] recently performed a meta-analysis focusing on the effects
of caffeine on soccer, finding no significant improvements in soccer-related performance
following caffeine supplementation. Therefore, although the positive effects that caffeine
supplementation  may  have  on  athletic  performance  in  certain  individual  sports  (e.g.,
running, cycling, etc.) are evident, it seems that more research is needed to determine the
ergogenic effect of acute caffeine intake in team sports.
Moreover, most of the studies included in the above-mentioned systematic reviews
and meta-analyses only included male athletes, as stated in a recent letter to the editor by
Salinero et al. entitled “More research is necessary to establish the ergogenic effect of caffeine in
female athletes”[12]. In this letter, the authors analyzed the percentage of females in studies
evaluating the ergogenic effects of caffeine, reporting that only 13% of the participants
were female. Moreover, although some studies included both male and female participants
(contributing to the aforementioned 13%), most of them drew conclusions for the whole
sample, irrespective of potential sex differences [13,14].
Despite the lack of research specifically analyzing female athletes, current guidelines
for caffeine supplementation are identically applied for both males and females [15]. How-
ever, these guidelines were established primarily from studies developed in males, which
is a clear limitation and raises concerns about their practicality. Although recent evidence
suggests that the pharmacokinetics of acute caffeine intake seems to be similar in all phases
of the menstrual cycle and that women athletes benefit from caffeine intake across all
phases of the menstrual cycle [
16], it is still possible that women obtain lower ergogenic
effects of oral caffeine intake due to the interaction of caffeine and female sex hormones [17].
Along these lines, Temple and Ziegler [18] found sex differences in subjective and physio-
logical responses to caffeine that were mediated by changes in circulating steroid hormones.
In fact, inconsistent results have been found when comparing the ergogenic effects of
106

Nutrients2021,13, 3663
caffeine in both sexes, with some studies finding some differences [19] while others found
none [20,21].  Moreover, some researchers have concluded that the ergogenic effect of
oral caffeine intake is present in both sexes but differs in its magnitude [22]. Along these
lines, Mielgo-Ayuso et al. [10] recently developed a systematic review including 10 studies
that evaluated the ergogenic effect of caffeine on both males and females. These authors
concluded that caffeine supplementation produced a similar ergogenic benefit regarding
aerobic performance and fatigue index in men and women, finding larger effects of caffeine
intake in men when anaerobic performance was evaluated, which could be critical for
team sports. However, the above-mentioned review only focused on the sex comparison;
consequently, many studies that only recruited females were excluded, and due to the low
number of included studies the authors chose not to perform a meta-analysis.
Thus, the aim of the present study is to perform a qualitative and quantitative analysis
of the existing literature regarding the effect of caffeine supplementation on physical
performance in adult female TSA.
2. Methods
2.1. Search Strategy
This systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out following the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines [23]
and was pre-registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021223046). A systematic search was per-
formed in the Pubmed/Medline, SPORTDiscus and Scopus databases.  The search was
performed from the inception of indexing until 1 September 2021, using the same search
syntax as Salinero et al. [9] for Pubmed. An analogous search was performed for SPORTDis-
cus and Scopus (Supplementary Material: Table S1). All articles were downloaded to a CSV
document to identify duplicates, and the whole process (i.e., identification, screening and
selection of studies) was independently performed by two authors, with any disagreements
resolved through discussion.
2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
The following inclusion criteria were applied to selected studies: (1) studies evaluating
the effect of an acute dose of isolated caffeine (e.g., not mixed with other supplements) on
physical performance in female TSA (if studies included both sexes we only selected data
for females, and if these data were not available we contacted the corresponding author
and requested them); (2) studies including adults (18 years of age or over); (3) crossover
studies that compared the intake of caffeine and a placebo; (4) studies using a blinded
and randomized design; (5) studies in English or Spanish.  Studies that supplied doses
below 1 mg/kg or above 9 mg/kg, that did not present a true placebo condition (thus
not allowing for blinding) or that did not evaluate performance-related variables (e.g.,
only evaluated oxidative stress markers) were excluded. Note that performance-related
variables are explained in detail in the “Data Extraction” section.
2.3. Quality Assessment and Risk of Bias
The Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale (PEDro) was used to evaluate the individ-
ual quality of each study, with studies being classified as excellent (score 9–10), good (score
6–8), fair (score 4–5) or poor (score < 4). The PEDro scale has been shown to be valid and
reliable for assessing the internal validity of randomized controlled trials [24].
Following the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines, the RoB 2 tool for randomized
crossover designs was applied to assess the risk of bias of each study included [25]. RoB 2
includes the following domains for crossover trials: (1) bias arising from the randomization
process; (2) bias due to deviations from the intended intervention; (3) bias due to missing
outcome data; (4) bias in the measurement of the outcome; (5) bias in the selection of the
reported results. Due to the characteristics of the crossover design, another domain related
to bias arising from the period effect and the carryover effect should be considered (domain
107

Nutrients2021,13, 3663
S). Finally, each study was classified as having a high risk of bias, some concerns or a low
risk of bias.
Both the PEDro and RoB2 tools were applied by two independent researchers, with
any disagreement resolved through consensus.
2.4. Data Extraction
Data from each individual study were collected for every variable presented inTable1,
including:  (1) the first author, year and country; (2) the number and characteristics of
participants and the sports modality; (3) the participants’ daily caffeine intake; (4) the
menstrual cycle phase and the presence of women using oral contraceptives; (5) the caffeine
administration form, timing and dosage; (6) the state of fatigue when the athletes were
tested (rest/fatigue condition); (7) the main performance outcomes.
For item 5, if the experiment involved different conditions besides isolated caffeine
(e.g., mixing sodium phosphate with caffeine [
26]), we only included the results of the
isolated caffeine condition [26,27]. Regarding item 6, we identified three possible conditions:
(a) fatigue: tests developed after a fatigue-inducing protocol, match or strenuous effort that
would cause fatigue to the participant; (b) match or simulated match: efforts developed
during a regular match situation with official rules (in some cases the match duration
was modified); (c) rest: tests developed without previous fatigue. These conditions were
analyzed separately, given that the effects of caffeine might be different in rested and
fatigued states.  In a rested condition, the aim of evaluating caffeine intake would be to
assess its effect on the performance of a specific task (e.g., jump performance). However,
in the fatigued condition, the main aim would be to evaluate the effect of caffeine intake
in minimizing the performance decline associated with fatigue by modulating the fatigue
itself or its perception (e.g., jump performance after a soccer match or at half-time). Finally,
for the match variables, the main aim would be to evaluate the effects of caffeine ingestion
during real match situations (accelerations, decelerations, etc.) that are influenced by both
physical and cognitive factors. For item 7, the main outcomes selected were team-sport
performance variables such as: jump performance; single sprint and RSA performance;
agility tests; maximal voluntary isometric-, concentric- and eccentric-force tests; muscular
endurance; anaerobic power (Wingate test); specific task performance (e.g., throwing a
ball of the specific sport); specific match variables (body impacts, sprint speed, total sprint
distance, accelerations and decelerations).  We also considered the rating of perceived
exertion (RPE) and fatigue indexes, as they are reliable proxies for physical performance
despite not being direct outcomes of athletic performance.
2.5. Meta-Analyses
For the meta-analyses, we collected mean and error measures or effect sizes with
confidence intervals. When these were not provided or when mean and error measures
were only presented in figures, we contacted the corresponding authors [27–34] to obtain
specific information (all authors replied).
Five studies included both males and females and analyzed them together, presenting
pooled data. We collected mean and error values only for the female group after contacting
the corresponding authors of two of the studies [14,35].  We did not include two stud-
ies
[36,37]that presented both sexes because the corresponding authors confirmed that
they involved the same participants and tests that were presented in the following two
studies that were included in the meta-analysis [
32,38].  We did not contact the authors
of one study that analyzed males and females together [
13] because the measured main
outcomes of the study were not of interest for the present review and meta-analysis.

2.6. Statistical Analyses
After calculating the standardized mean difference as the individual effect size of each
study for each relevant variable, the results were pooled using the DerSimonian–Laird
method in a random-effects meta-analysis [39]. A minimum of three studies was required
in order to perform the meta-analyses. When calculating the standardized mean difference
between conditions within each meta-analysis, the data were set to indicate that a positive
value always represented a difference in performance favoring the caffeine condition.
A sensitivity analysis was performed excluding those studies that administered less
than 2 mg of caffeine per kg of body mass [33,40,41] as this has been suggested to be the
minimum effective ergogenic dose [17].
We tested the heterogeneity using the I
2
statistic [42].  This statistic describes the
variance between studies as a proportion of the total variance. A value of 25–50% indicates
low heterogeneity, between 50–75% indicates moderate heterogeneity and >75% indicates
high heterogeneity.
3. Results
3.1. Main Search
The literature search provided a total of 588 studies, with 4 additional studies found
through cross-referencing. A total of 54 full-text articles were read, and 18 met the inclusion
criteria and were included in the systematic review. Figure1presents the PRISMA flow
chart and the reasons for excluding articles from the final sample of selected studies.
Figure 1.PRISMA flow-chart diagram.
3.2. Quality Assessment and Risk of Bias
The individual PEDro quality scores ranged from 8 to 10, being excellent in 15 studies
and good in 3 studies (Supplementary Material: Table S2). Three crossover trials did not
meet the requirements related to therapist and assessor blinding [33,35,40], and the study
performed by Fernandez-Campos et al. [41] did not include drop-outs in the analysis.
117

Nutrients2021,13, 3663
Regarding the RoB 2 tool results, 14 studies showed a low risk of bias in all domains,
4 studies demonstrated some concerns for domain 2 “bias due to deviations from intended
interventions” and 3 studies showed some concerns for domain 4 “bias in measurement of
the outcome” (Supplementary Material: Table S3). Additionally, all studies had a low risk
of bias in the specific domain for crossover designs “bias arising from the period effect and
carryover effect” (domain S). Thus, the overall biases were low for 14 studies, with some
concern in the other studies.
3.3. Description of Participants and Studies
Six studies were performed in Spain. Two studies were developed in the United States
of America, New Zealand and Taiwan.  Australia, Iran, Costa Rica, Serbia, Turkey and
Singapore each provided one study. The origin of each individual study is presented in the
first column of Table1.
The main characteristics of each study are presented in Table1.  The 18 studies in-
cluded provided a total of 240 young adult female TSA (the mean age for all studies
was in the range of 18 to 26 years). Of this sample, 50 participants were basketball play-
ers
[14,35,38,43],40 were volleyball players [30,33,41], 37 were soccer players [29,40], 32
were rugby players [28,31] and 15 were handball players [32]. The rest of the studies used
a sample of mixed TSA including basketball, volleyball, handball, soccer, rugby, softball,
hockey and netball players [26,27,34,44–46].
3.4. Caffeine Supplementation and Doses
Caffeine doses ranged from 1.3 mg/kg to 6 mg/kg, mainly ingested through: capsules:
nine studies [14,26,27,32,34,38,43–45], powders: five studies [28–31,35], energy drinks: two
studies [40,41], power bars: one study [33] or coffee [46].
All studies supplied the caffeine 60 min before the experiments, except forMahdavi et al. [43],
who provided the caffeine supplementation 70 min before, Fernandez-Campos et al. [41]
who provided it 30 min before and Pfeifer et al. [33] who specified that the dose “was
administered immediately prior to and during the competition”.
Regarding caffeine withdrawal as part of the standardization procedures, although
different instructions to volunteers were found among the studies (Specified in Table1),
most studies required participants to abstain from all dietary sources of caffeine for 48 h
before the trials.
Finally, regarding the days that passed between the placebo and caffeine conditions,
five studies performed washout periods of 48 to 96 h, with most studies performing one-
week washout periods (10 studies). Three studies performed even longer washouts (13 to
21 days). Individual information for each study is provided in Table1.
3.5. Menstrual Cycle
In the first four studies that were published between 2011 and 2014 [27–29,40], the
phase of the menstrual cycle and the use of oral contraceptives was not reported. From
2015, some studies reported the menstrual cycle phase while others were even more strict
and performed the evaluations when participants were in a specific phase. For example,
Buck et al. [26] standardized the assessments with the protocol of starting in the first three
days after the last menstruation (follicular phase), Chen et al. [34] instructed athletes to
participate during their early follicular phase and Puente et al. [14], Stojanovic et al. [38]
and Karayigit et al. [46] completed their assessments during the luteal phase.  Specific
phases and the use of oral contraceptives are specified in Table1.
3.6. Rested, Match and Fatigued Conditions
For the rested and match conditions, enough studies were included to perform a meta-
analysis, as presented below.  For the fatigued condition, meta-analyses of RPE, agility,
RSA and maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) were performed.  We could
not perform a meta-analysis for the other fitness tests in a fatigued condition due to the
118

Nutrients2021,13, 3663
heterogeneity of the performed tests.  Nonetheless, the last column of Table1presents
three different symbols reflecting the effectiveness of caffeine supplementation in each
individual study, with an up-arrow representing a positive effect.  Of the 18 included
studies, 10 performed tests including a fatigued state.  Of these 10 studies, a total of 46
variables were analyzed after participants were already fatigued, finding a positive effect
of caffeine for only 8 variables, as specified in the last column of Table1.

Four studies evaluated body impacts during a match, including studies of volley-
ball [30], basketball [14], handball [32] and rugby players [31]. The meta-analysis including
total body impacts is presented in Figure2A and shows that caffeine did improve inten-
sity during a match (standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.488; 95% CI: 0.050, 0.927).
Heterogeneity among the studies was low (I
2
49%,p= 0.117).
3.7.2. Specific Sport Drills
Four studies analyzed a specific sport movement (Figure2B). On the one hand, Perez-
Lopez et al. [30] analyzed the speed of a volleyball ball in a jumping spike, while Muñoz
et al. analyzed the speed ofa9mhandball throw against a goalkeeper. On the other hand,
Puente et al. [14] and Tan et al. [35] measured basketball throw performance.  Caffeine
improved performance on overall specific sport drills (SMD: 0.384; 95% CI: 0.077, 0.691).
Heterogeneity among the studies was low (I
2
0,p= 0.699). A subgroup meta-analysis was
performed, showing that caffeine improved ball speed (SMD: 0.440; 95% CI: 0.098; I
2
0%
p= 0.903)but did not improve effectiveness during basketball free throws (SMD: 0.150,
95% CI:−0.549, 0.849; I
2
0%p= 0.347).
3.7.3. Jump Performance
Seven studies evaluated jump performance using either countermovement jumps
(CMJ), Abalakov jumps (ABA) or squat jumps (SJ). One study did not describe the jump
performed,  calling it a vertical jump [33].   As shown in Figure2C, caffeine showed a
positive effect on CMJ performance (SMD: 0.208, 95% CI: 0.079, 0.338; I
2
0%p= 0.989). The
sensitivity analysis excluding the Fernandez-Campos study due to the supplied dosage of
caffeine (<2 mg/kg) revealed similar results (SMD: 0.217, 95% CI: 0.085, 0.348) with a low
heterogeneity (I
2
0%p= 0.994).
Another meta-analysis was performed including three studies that measured SJ with
the intake of caffeine showing no improvement in SJ performance (Figure2D: SMD: 0.241,
95% CI:−0.189, 0.671; I
2
0%p= 0.870). The sensitivity analysis excluding the Fernandez-
Campos study revealed similar results (SMD: 0.345, 95% CI:−0.237, 0.928; I
2
0%p= 0.926).
3.7.4. Agility
From the six studies that evaluated agility in a rested state, three used thet-test [27,30,40],
while one study used a modified version of the t-test [32], one study used the change-of-
direction and acceleration test (CODAT) [14] and one study used the lane agility drill [38].
Figure3A presents the performed meta-analysis including all the agility tests, showing
that caffeine did not improve agility (SMD: 0.144, 95% CI:−0.127, 0.416; I
2
0%p= 0.939).

0%p= 0.892).
3.7.5. Handgrip
Figure3B shows the effects of caffeine on handgrip strength, which was measured
in three studies, with Muñoz [32] reporting the mean strength of both hands in handball
players, while Perez-Lopez [30] and Fernandez-Campos [41] reported separated values for
the left and right hands of volleyball players (the right hand was selected for the present
meta-analysis as it is usually the dominant hand). The meta-analysis showed that caffeine
had a positive effect on handgrip performance (SMD: 0.395, 95% CI: 0.126, 0.665). A low
heterogeneity was found (I
2
0%p= 0.476). A sensitivity analysis excluding the Fernandez-
Campos study did not change the main effect of caffeine (SMD: 0.467, 95% CI: 0.047, 0.887)
or the low heterogeneity (I
2
25%p= 0.238).
3.7.6. Single Sprint Performance
Single sprint performance was evaluated in five studies, from which two performed
a single sprint [32,38] and three performed an RSA test, with the first sprint selected for
the present meta-analysis [26,28,29]. A subgroup meta-analysis was performed for studies
that used a single sprint on the one hand and for studies that used the first sprint of an
RSA test on the other hand.  All the studies performed a 30 m sprint except for that of
Stojanovi ́c and colleagues [38] who used a 20 m sprint. As presented in Figure4A, caffeine
showed no effect on single sprint performance (SMD: 0.225, 95% CI:−0.022, 0.472; I
2
0%
p= 0.685). Nonetheless, when dividing studies into two groups according to the type of
measurement performed (single sprint or first sprint of an RSA test), we found that those
studies that performed a single sprint reported a performance improvement (SMD: 0.347,
95% CI: 0.038, 0.656; I
2
0%p= 0.903), while in those studies that performed a RSA test,
caffeine did not improve the performance of the first sprint (SMD: 0.011, 95% CI:−0.399,
0.420; I
2
0%p= 0.737).

3.7.7. RSA
Three studies included an RSA test, with Del Coso et al. [28] using a 6×30 m RSA
test, Lara et al. [
29] using a 7×30 m RSA test and Buck et al. [26] using a 6×20 m RSA
test. As shown in Figure4B, caffeine showed no effect on RSA (SMD: 0.155, 95% CI:−0.254,
0.565; I
2
0%p= 0.826).
122

Nutrients2021,13, 3663
3.7.8. RPE
As shown in Figure4C, nine studies evaluated RPE after performing an exercise
protocol after caffeine supplementation, finding no effect of this supplement on RPE (SMD:
0.258, 95% CI:−0.048, 0.565; I
2
0.26%p= 0.260).
3.7.9. Fatigued State
Six studies performed the assessments after applying a specific fatigue protocol or
after a match.  A meta-analysis could only be performed for the agility tests, as three
studies evaluated agility after performing several all-out sprint tests [
27,40] or after a
match [
33], with the pooled results showing no positive effects on agility after fatiguing
the participants, as shown in Figure5(SMD: 0.069, 95% CI:−0.400, 0.538; I
2
0%p= 0.858).
It should be highlighted that the caffeine doses for two of the aforementioned studies were
below 2 mg/kg [33,40].

4. Discussion
The main findings of the present systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that
oral caffeine administration before exercise has an ergogenic effect on specific team-sport
skills, CMJ height, handgrip strength and total body impacts in female TSA. Nonetheless,
caffeine did not show an ergogenic effect on RPE, SJ, agility, RSA or tests performed in a
fatigued state.
The positive effects of caffeine supplementation on CMJ are in accordance with most
of the previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses developed for team sports [8–10],
although Ferreira and colleagues [
11] did not find a positive effect of caffeine in their
meta-analysis including male soccer players. Nonetheless, we also found that caffeine had
no effect on SJ performance. This could partially be explained by the low number of studies
(n= 3) evaluating the effect of caffeine on SJ performance. When considering Figure2D, it
appears that caffeine had a positive effect in the three studies, although the overall effect
was not significant probably due to the low number of studies.
Muscle force and consequently CMJ could both determine specific athletic skills
performance, which is of critical importance for TSA and was found to be improved by
caffeine supplementation. Nonetheless, we only found a positive effect for the subgroup
meta-analysis that included ball speed, which might be influenced by technique and upper-
body strength/power.  This would suggest that caffeine could be useful for those team
sports in which upper-body strength/power is a determinant (e.g., volleyball, basketball
or handball).   Nevertheless,  these results should be interpreted with caution,  as only
two studies measured ball speed, and the two studies that evaluated accuracy (through
basketball free throws) found no ergogenic effects [14,35].
The improvement in CMJ performance was accompanied by an improvement in single
sprint performance (when studies that only performed one sprint were included). This is
in line with previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which found positive results
in single sprints developed with TSA [8,9]. When we included the first sprint of studies
that performed an RSA test the ergogenic effect of caffeine disappeared. We could therefore
hypothesize that those participants who were going to complete an RSA test might not
have performed the first sprint at their maximal capacity, and that caffeine supplementation
123

Nutrients2021,13, 3663
does indeed have a positive effect on single sprint performance when participants are
performing a single maximal-effort sprint.
Although single sprint performance is important, most team-sport athletes will need
to perform several sprints during a match with short low-intensity periods between them.
Consequently,  several studies performed RSA tests in order to evaluate the ability of
athletes to maintain sprint intensity. We found that caffeine supplementation had no effect
on RSA in our meta-analysis, which disagrees with some previous systematic reviews and
meta-analyses carried out with samples of men and women involved in team sports [9,10]
but is in line with others [7,11].  Again, a small number of studies were included in our
meta-analysis (n= 3), and therefore the results should be interpreted with caution, as more
studies including female TSA are necessary.
The positive findings in upper-limbs isometric muscle force are in line with a recent
meta-analysis developed by Grgic and Del Coso [47] focusing on the effects of caffeine on
strength and power, finding that caffeine improved upper-body performance in women.
This could be critical for female TSA, as an improvement in muscular endurance and
strength could enable TSA to develop improved performance during a match.  Along
these lines, we did find improvements in total body impacts (a proxy for the players’
match intensity), which would imply higher intensities during competition. Consequently,
although athletes might not be able to improve RSA under laboratory conditions, they
might be more motivated during a match and be capable of improving intensity due to the
ergogenic effect of caffeine. These positive findings are in line with previous meta-analyses
that found improvements in the performed number of sprints during a real or simulated
match after acute caffeine ingestion [9].
The lack of effect of caffeine ingestion on agility tests was surprising and contradicted
results from a previous meta-analysis which included mainly male participants (two studies
evaluated females out of eight studies included) [
9]. These contrasting results highlight the
importance of performing more research with female athletes, as the scientific community
may be assuming that what works with males will work in exactly the same way with
females, while we have found some differences in the current meta-analysis.
Regarding RPE, our findings are similar to those of previous meta-analyses developed
for team sports [9,11] which found no effects of caffeine on RPE. These studies and ours,
which are all focused on team sports, show opposite results to those found in a larger
meta-analysis developed in 2005 [48] which found a 6% reduction in RPE after the ingestion
of caffeine in endurance tests.  In the 21 included studies (where 7 measured females),
there were 13 cycling tests, 5 running tests, 2 rowing tests and 1 swimming test.  It is
important to notice that the aforementioned meta-analysis showed a reduction in RPE
only when constant loads were applied.   Team sports are characterized by numerous
high-intensity efforts followed by rest periods and do not follow a constant load pattern,
which could explain the lack of effect of caffeine on RPE found in the present meta-analysis.
Nonetheless, this may only be partially true, as a previous study [48] also found that,
although no differences were found at the end of a test to exhaustion, caffeine attenuated
RPE during exercise, which could partially explain the performance improvements found
in some athletes. Most of the studies included in our meta-analysis only included an RPE
assessment at the end of the tests or matches, but it would be interesting for future studies
to consider RPE throughout exercise. This would allow researchers to test if a reduced RPE,
and therefore an increased physical performance for the same intensity, is found during a
match or a laboratory test.
Along the same lines, it would be interesting to evaluate the effects of caffeine in
fatigued conditions, as many of the presented studies in the current meta-analysis were
developed in laboratory settings and included participants in a rested state who performed
the test (agility, jumps, etc.)  60 min after the ingestion of caffeine.  Nonetheless, given
that TSA are usually exposed to fatiguing efforts, it would be interesting to develop more
studies in fatigued conditions, as caffeine presents the ability to cross the blood–brain
barrier and block the adenosine receptors in the brain, mitigating the negative effects of
124

Nutrients2021,13, 3663
fatigue.  Very few studies have evaluated the effects of caffeine after applying a fatigue
protocol (n= 3, 2 and 2 for agility, RSA and MVIC, respectively). The only meta-analysis
performed showed a lack of effect of caffeine on agility performance when participants
were fatigued.  Nonetheless, caffeine doses for two [
33,40] of the three studies included
were below 2 mg/kg, and therefore further studies are required to evaluate the effects
of higher doses in fatigued female TSA. Although we could not perform a further meta-
analysis including the fatigued state, the results from Table1suggest a lack of effect as the
last column shows that out of the 46 variables that were registered in fatigued conditions,
only 8 improved after caffeine ingestion.
In order to improve research in this topic, we would encourage future studies to
report the menstrual cycle phase of participants when performing the experiments and
to perform both placebo and supplementation trials during the same menstrual cycle
phase, in order to reduce the possible effect of the menstrual cycle phase. The use of oral
contraceptives should also be registered. Experiments should test both rested and fatigued
conditions, register individual responses to caffeine which were not reported in most of the
studies included in the present meta-analysis and evaluate if in “responders” lower dosages
have the same effect or if increasing the dose in “non-responders” has a positive effect.
This is because previous articles have identified substantial inter-individual variations
following  caffeine  ingestion  in  sport  [
49].   These  differences  seem  to  be  mediated  by
genetic variations, and the characterization of the athlete’s genetic profile could potentially
help in individualizing the caffeine dose accurately to optimize its effect on physical
performance [49].
Finally, it is worth mentioning that five of the included studies used energy drinks that,
in addition to caffeine, contained other substances that could also have an ergogenic effect,
such as sugar, glucuronolactone and taurine. Nonetheless, three [28–30] of these studies
specified that the placebo drink and the energy drink were exactly the same drinks with the
only difference being the caffeine content (the placebo had 0 mg/kg). The two remaining
studies were those developed by Astorino et al. [40] and by Fernandez-Campos et al. [41].
Astorino et al. [40] used an energy drink containing both taurine and glucuronolactone.
The taurine content was 1 g, which is far from the 6 g suggested to have an ergogenic
effect [
50,51].  In the case of glucuronolactone, as stated by Campos-Perez in the book
Sports and Energy drinks: “because of the few investigations on the isolate glucuronolactone
in humans, there is no evidence to support the idea of adding this compound to energy
drinks to improve physical and sport performance,  not even as a complement to the
action of taurine and/or caffeine” [
52]. Therefore, the only added ingredient that could
make a difference in the included studies and influence performance was sugar, with
the Astorino et al. [
40] study showing a difference of 7 g (energy drink 27 g vs. placebo
20 g of sugar) and the Fernandez-Campos et al. [
41] study showing a difference of 31 g
(energy drink 31 g vs. placebo 0 g of sugar). Nonetheless, both studies were included in the
sensitivity analyses, and we consequently repeated the meta-analyses without including
them, finding similar results. Therefore, the possible effect that other ergogenic substances
might have that could enhance the findings attributed to caffeine were controlled for in the
present meta-analysis.
Although the present meta-analysis presents several strengths, such as the focus on
an athlete population with limited previous scientific evidence (female TSA), the effort to
contact the corresponding authors to obtain specific data for this group and the inclusion
of the updated 2021 PRISMA guidelines, it is not without limitations, the main one being
the low number of studies included in some of the meta-analyses (n= 3).
5. Conclusions
Although caffeine is generally considered as one of the most useful supplements
used to increase athletic performance, the results of the present meta-analysis suggest
that more research is needed in female TSA. Female TSA obtained benefits from caffein
supplementation as it was shown to improve upper-body strength and sport-specific tasks

related to upper-body strength (ball speed), in addition to CMJ, single sprint performance
and body impacts during a match (match intensity).

Abstract:Eccentric contraction can easily cause muscle damage and an inflammatory response, which
reduces the efficiency of muscle contraction. Resveratrol causes anti-inflammatory effects in muscles,
accelerates muscle repair, and promotes exercise performance after contusion recovery. However,
whether resveratrol provides the same benefits for sports injuries caused by eccentric contraction
is unknown. Thus, we explored the effects of resveratrol on inflammation and energy metabolism.
In this study,  mice were divided into four groups:  a control group,  an exercise group (EX), an
exercise with low-dose resveratrol group (EX + RES25), and an exercise with high-dose resveratrol
group (EX + RES150). The results of an exhaustion test showed that the time before exhaustion of
the EX + RES150 group was greater than that of the EX group.  Tumour necrosis factor-
α(Tnfα)
mRNA expression was lower in the EX + RES150 group than in the EX group. The energy utilisation
of the EX + RES150 group was greater than that of the EX + RES25 group in different muscles.
High-dose resveratrol intervention decreasedTnf
αmRNA expression and enhanced the mRNA
expressions of sirtuin 1, glucose transporter 4, AMP-activated protein kinaseα1, and AMP-activated
protein kinaseα2 in muscles.  These results revealed that high-dose resveratrol supplementation
can reduce inflammation and oxidation and improve energy utilisation during short-duration high-
intensity exercise.

1. Introduction
A  habit  of  exercise  contributes  to  effective  metabolism,  strong  muscles,  and  low
fatigue [
1] and protects against metabolic disorders and even cognitive impairment in
older adults [
2,3].  However, poor exercise habits can cause muscle damage.  Mice were
made to execute eccentric contraction that caused the overextension of muscle fibres [
4].
When such muscle damage occurs, macrophages are polarised as M1 macrophages by
tumour necrosis factor-α(TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) to prevent damage to the muscle
cells [4,5]. During a rest period, these M1 macrophages are converted to M2 macrophages
by  anti-inflammatory  factors  (i.e.,  insulin-like  growth  factor  1  and  interleukin  10)  for
muscle reconstruction [5,6]. Increased levels of IL-6 and TNF-αin adipose tissue have been
observed in individuals with obesity during long-duration eccentric contraction exercise [
7];
however, the related cytokine mechanism is not understood.

For improved sports performance, 500 mg/d of resveratrol has been combined with
physical  exercise  to  improve  mitochondrial  volume  density  and  muscle  function  and
increase total myonuclei in older adults [8]. Resveratrol use has been reported to prevent
muscle stiffness and soreness resulting from damage to sarcomeres in muscle fibre [9] and
the excitation–contraction coupling system [10]; damage which further causes delayed
onset muscle soreness.  Studies have also supported that resveratrol is involved in the
activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) during muscle contraction over a
longer exercise period [11]. Active AMPK is attributed to the translocation and activation
of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to improve glucose utilisation and the proliferation of
mitochondria in muscles [12].
Most resting muscles present as contracted. However, in the early stages of muscle
excitement, fewer reactive oxidative species (ROS), which promote more muscle contraction
to balance energy utilisation, are produced [
13]. The more intensive the exercise is, the more
ROS are produced by muscle excitement [
14]. During high-intensity short-duration exercise,
greater muscle contraction causes more ROS production, resulting in injury and reduced
muscle contraction as well as overtraining syndrome (OTS) [13]. Cheng et al. reported that
selected antioxidant treatments did not improve force recovery after fatiguing stimulation
of skeletal muscle fibres in a mouse model [15]. However, some studies have shown that
intervention targeting selected antioxidants altered oxidative stress in athletes with OTS by
reducing plasma malondialdehyde levels [
16] and resulted in improved muscle function in
individuals with adjuvant-induced arthritis [17]. The effects of antioxidant intervention in
various exercise types remain disputed and unclear.
Resveratrol use has been reported to benefit health and has therapeutic effects in
humans [
18].  Many studies have shown that resveratrol possesses antiaging [19], anti-
cancer, anti-atherosclerosis, and anti-inflammatory effects; increases insulin sensitivity;
and contributes to the reduction in ROS levels [
20]. Resveratrol presents as atrans-form
polyphenolic compound in nature, commonly found in grape skin, cherries, and peanuts.
When consumed orally, trans-resveratrol is rapidly converted to the more biologically
active form of dihydroresveratrol [
21].  This resveratrol form has been reported to regu-
late sirtuin 1 (SIRT 1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-α
(PGC-1α), AMPK, and TNF-α, which enforces cell mitochondrial function, increases insulin
sensitivity, and inhibits inflammation and low-density lipoprotein oxidation in individuals
with diabetes [20,22,23].
This study used a downhill running exercise to mimic eccentric contraction injury
and assess the efficacy of resveratrol in mice models. We hypothesised that giving mice
different doses of resveratrol would protect against the damage caused by short-duration
high-intensity eccentric exercise. The mechanisms of resveratrol involved in muscle inflam-
mation, energy utilisation, and exercise performance were also evaluated.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Materials
Trans-resveratrol was provided by Tokyo Chemistry Industry. All chemicals used in
this study were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
2.2. Animals
C57BL/6J mice (aged 6 weeks) were purchased from the National Laboratory Animal
Center (Taipei, Taiwan). All animals were fed on a chow diet (Rodent Laboratory Chow
5001, LabDiet, St. Louis, MO, USA) and distilled waterad libitum. Mice were housed in a
regular cycle (12 h light/dark) at room temperature (23±2
◦
C) and 60–70% humidity in the
Taipei Medical University Laboratory Animal Center. All animal experimental protocols
were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Taipei
Medical University (LAC-2021-0310).

2.3. Experiment Design
C57BL/6J mice were housed in the animal facility for 1 week for them to adapt to the
environment before the study. Twenty-four mice were randomly assigned into four equal
groups: control (NC), exercise (EX), exercise with low-dose resveratrol (25 mg/kg body
weight;
EX + RES25), and exercise with high-dose resveratrol (150 mg/kg body weight;
EX + RES150). The mice in the EX, EX + RES25, and EX + RES150 groups underwent 3 days
of acclimation running before undertaking the incremental load test (ILT). Acclimation
involved running 10 m/min for 15 min with an incline of 0
◦
each day for 3 days.  All
the mice underwent an exhaustion test the day after the ILT, and the downhill running
section of the study started the following week.  Resveratrol was dissolved in distilled
water.  EX-treated mice were gavaged with various amounts (25 mg/kg/d [RES25] and
150 mg/kg/d [RES150] in 0.5 mL of normal saline) of resveratrol or the vehicle (0.5 mL of
normal saline) for C and EX groups for 4 weeks (Figure1).

(n=6); EX + RES25: exercise with resveratrol 25 mg/kg (n= 6); EX + RES150: exercise with resveratrol
150 mg/kg (n= 6).
2.4. ILT, Exhaustion Test, and Downhill Running
Mice undertook the ILT on a motorised treadmill (Rodent Treadmill 47300, Ugo Basile,
Italy).  The intensity of exercise was programmed to increase by 3 m/min (initial speed:
12 m/min) in the first 3 min and mice ran on a 0% gradient until exhaustion [24]. Individual
exhaustion velocity (EV) was determined from the results. The same exercise protocol was
used in the exhaustion test. After a 3-day acclimation to running and the ILT, the mice of
groups EX, EX + RES25 and EX + RES150 ran on a motorised treadmill (−15
◦
slope) at
22 m/min (60% EV), 2 h/day, 5 days/week for 2 weeks [25]. Training interventions were
conducted between 10 am and 6 pm.
2.5. Sample Collection
After the downhill running test, mice were euthanized by a CO
2
inhalation overdose
and were sacrificed for biopsy, including biopsies of the liver, epididymal adipose tissue
(eWAT), gastrocnemius muscle, soleus muscle, and tibialis anterior muscle, which were
collected and stored at−80
◦
C for biochemical analyses. Skin irritation was also evaluated
in all animals at the end of the study.

2.6. Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR)
RNA was extracted using RNAzol RT (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH,
USA) according to manufacturer guidelines. 1μg of RNA was reverse transcribed using
a TOOLSQuant II fast RT kit (BIOTOOLS, Taiwan). Genes were quantified using specific
primers with SYBR green using the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 1 Real-Time PCR
System. The final quantification was executed using the 2−ΔΔCT method with glyceralde-
hyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) primer as a control. The sequences of primers
are shown in Table1.

2.7. Next Generation Sequencing Analysis
First, cDNA libraries were collected from four independent samples in each group.
The cDNA libraries were assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system and the Real-
Time PCR system.β-Actin served as an internal control to verify the quality and quantity
of cDNA in the PCR system. The sequenced libraries underwent fragment size detection
using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system and library concentration determination using
the Real-Time PCR system; the quality-confirmed libraries underwent 150-bp paired-end
sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Genomics, BioSci & Tech Company,
New Taipei City, Taiwan). Raw sequencing reads were filtered using Trimmomatic (version
0.36) [26]. Reads were aligned using Bowtie2 (version 2.3.5) [27]. Raw gene counts were
extracted using RSEM (version 1.3.3) [
28].  The R package edgeR (v3.16.5) was used for
the differential gene expression analysis of two sample groups. Furthermore, the log
2
fold
change was calculated as log
2
(sample count 1/sample count 2).  Thet-test was used to
identify significant differences between samples from the two groups (p< 0.05).  Gene
ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was conducted on the differential genes obtained
through screening. Whenp< 0.05, GO terms were significantly enriched [29]. The Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes was used for the gene enrichment of differentially
expressed genes.
2.8. Statistical Analysis
All results are expressed in terms of the mean±SEM. The significance of the difference
was examined using GraphPad Prism version 9.0 (GraphPad Software; San Diego, CA,
USA). All data were normally distributed. Significant differences were analyzed using a
student’s t-test or one-way analysis of variance with Tukey’s test and Bonferroni’s test for
multiple comparisons. Ap-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

3.6. MA Plot, Volcano Plot, and Bar Charts for EX vs. EX + RES150 Groups
In the EX and EX + RES150 groups, 37 genes were more significantly upregulated, and
77 genes were more significantly downregulated in the high-dose group than in the EX
group (Figure8).
As shown in the biological process plot,  pathway regulation occurred due to the
intervention of high-dose resveratrol, such as the positive regulation of cytokine produc-
tion (Figure9A). Analysis of molecular function showed that the regulation of pathways
related to energy hydrolysis enzymes also occurred, indicated, for example, by nucleoside-
triphosphatase regulator activity and GTPase regulator activity (Figure9B). In addition,
as shown by the cellular component bar chart, most regulated pathways were found to
be related to immunity, such as MHC class II proteins or lysosomal membrane proteins
(
Figure9C).  Higher doses of resveratrol have a greater effect on facial features during
exercise and may have greater anti-inflammatory, energy utilisation-related, and immune-
boosting effects.

4. Discussion
In this experiment, we used short-duration downhill running and different dosages
of resveratrol to evaluate inflammation and energy utilisation in the different muscles of
mice.  The main findings were: (1) the time before exhaustion decreased due to exercise
injury; this was counteracted by the intervention of resveratrol; (2) inflammation in the
muscles was reduced by the intervention of resveratrol; (3) the expression of genes related
to energy utilisation in the EX + RES150 group was significantly higher than in the EX
group, indicating that the intervention of resveratrol increases muscle energy utilisation.
The time to exhaustion in the EX group was significantly lower than that in the NC,
EX + RES25, and EX + RES150 groups.  The results of this experiment demonstrate that
resveratrol supplementation is beneficial for endurance exercise.  Our study found no
difference in endurance performance between the low-dose group and the high-dose group.
This difference between this study and ours may have been due to differences in exercise
mode (weight-loaded swimming in the previous study).

Nutrients2023,15, 249
TNF-αand IL-6 levels are often used to indicate inflammation. When an inflammatory
response  occurs,  the  production  of  cytokines  in  injured  tissues  increases  significantly.
Tnf
αmRNA expression in the EX group was significantly higher than that in the NC
group, confirming that exercise injury elevated the production of TNF-α[30]. Resveratrol
effectively reduced inflammation;  high doses of resveratrol exerted anti-inflammatory
effects in different muscles. In long-duration exercises, reaching exhaustion always results
in high levels of oxidative stress. A high-intensity cycling-based clinical trial demonstrated
that resveratrol supplementation attenuated exercise-induced serum interleukin-6 levels
but not oxidative stress [31]. Such physical phenomena imply that resveratrol affects anti-
inflammation and antioxidation processes independently.  IL-6 production is positively
correlated with glucose uptake by GLUT4 in muscles [
32–34].  In our study, the mRNA
expression of IL-6 did not differ between different muscle tissues, but the repression of
Glut4mRNA was observed in the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. This suggests that
increased mRNA levels of IL-6 and GLUT4 occur synchronously; thus, IL-6 may trigger
GLUT4-induced glucose utilisation in muscle.
Many studies have found that during endurance exercise, due to the reduction in
available glycogen in the body, more AMPK is activated to facilitate the production of
downstream products, providing the body with energy [
35].  During exercise, the inter-
vention of resveratrol resulted in the activation not only of AMPK but also SIRT1 and its
downstream proteins GLUT4 and PGC-1αand in miR-22-3p in a muscle cell model [36].
Resveratrol  also  exhibited  dual  bioactive  effects  in  our  study;  however,  the  effects  of
resveratrol remain unclear.
Type I muscle fibres support long-duration exercise, type II fibres support explosive
short-duration exercise, and type IIx fibres transform into different types of fibres in relation
to the intensity of the physical activity at hand [37]. The mRNA expression of AMPKα1in
the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles in the EX group did not differ from that in
the NC group. We hypothesise that the type IIx muscle fibres in these muscles were not
converted into type I muscle fibres because the exercise period was not long enough for
the fibres to adapt to endurance exercise. The effect of resveratrol on AMPK activation in
the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles was greater than that caused by exercise.
However, no differences inAmpkα1andAmpkα2mRNA expression in the soleus muscle
between the EX and the NC groups were found. These apparently conflicting results were
also observed in a 12-week study [38], and we speculate that the two-week duration of this
experiment was insufficient for a long-term exercise study. However, the soleus muscle
has a high proportion of red muscle, which supports aerobic exercise. Thus, the significant
differences between the NC and EX groups can be attributed to resveratrol intervention.
The mRNA expression of GLUT4 in the gastrocnemius muscle and soleus muscle in
the EX + RES150 group was significantly higher than that in the EX group.  This result
is consistent with the findings of a previous study that the intervention of resveratrol
in muscle cells effectively increases the amount of GLUT4 translocated to the plasma
membrane [
39].  The tibialis anterior muscle does not exhibit similar effects; the ratio of
red to white muscle in the tibialis anterior muscle may contribute to this [
38].  Studies
have demonstrated that white muscle fibres can activate GLUT4 translocation during
exercise [
40];  the gastrocnemius muscle has a higher proportion of white muscle and
exhibits higherGlut4mRNA expression. Pereira BC et al. reported that excessive eccentric
contraction training impairs insulin signal transduction in mice’s skeletal muscles and
reduces the rate of GLUT4 translocation [
41]. Thus, muscle injury may have caused the
mRNA expression of GLUT4 in the soleus muscle in the EX group to be significantly lower
than in the other groups.
As an oxidoreductase, SIRT1 regulates various cellular events, including apoptosis,
cell survival, endocrine signalling, and gene transcription [42]. SIRT1 activates the down-
stream product PGC-1α, and PGC-1αregulates mitochondrial biosynthesis to facilitate
the regulation of oxidative metabolism [43]. The mRNA expression of SIRT1 and PGC-1α
in the gastrocnemius muscle, tibialis anterior muscle, and soleus muscle increased sig-
140

Nutrients2023,15, 249
nificantly with the intervention of high-dose resveratrol compared with the NC group,
which is consistent with the results of previous studies [
44], indicating resveratrol inter-
vention for short-duration exercise can effectively increase energy utilisation and cause an
antioxidising effect.
In this study, we assessed genome expression under resveratrol intervention in short-
duration eccentric contraction exercises. We focused on muscle inflammation and energy
utilisation–related gene expression. One gene that was intensively activated after high-dose
resveratrol intervention was myosin light chain kinase 2 (ENSMUSG00000027470), which
is intensively expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle [45] and regulates the interaction of
myosin and actin through the concentration of calcium ions protein cross bridge [46]. In this
experiment, high-dose resveratrol intensively activated this gene, thus we hypothesise that
resveratrol increases muscle contraction ability during exercise. NADH dehydrogenase
subunit 5 (ENSMUSG00000064367) is part of mitochondrial complex I, a large enzyme
complex that is active in mitochondria [47]. We found that this gene was upregulated in the
presence of intervening resveratrol. Therefore, we hypothesise that due to the increase in the
expression of this gene, oxidative phosphorylation on the inner mitochondrial membrane
and the production of ATP increased, providing the cell with more energy and thereby
increasing the utilisation of energy during exercise. Gene ontology enrichment table of EX
vs. EX + RES150 included biological process, molec-ular function and cellular component
is shown in Supplementary Table S1.
5. Conclusions
High-dose resveratrol intervention prolonged the time before exhaustion for short-
duration downhill running.  High-dose resveratrol intervention decreasedTnf
αmRNA
expression and enhanced the mRNA expressions of SIRT1, GLUT4, AMPKα1, and AMPK
α2 in some muscles.  These results indicate that high-dose resveratrol supplementation
can reduce inflammation and oxidation and improve the utilisation of energy during
short-duration high-intensity exercise.

Abstract:
Dietary supplements are widely used as a nutritional strategy to improve and maintain
performance and achieve faster recovery in sports and exercise. Exercise-induced muscle damage
(EIMD) is caused by mechanical stress and subsequent inflammatory responses including reactive
oxygen species and cytokine production. Therefore, dietary supplements with anti-inflammatory
and antioxidant properties have the potential to prevent and reduce muscle damage and symptoms
characterized by loss of muscle strength and delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS). However, only
a few supplements are considered to be effective at present.  This review focuses on the effects of
dietary supplements derived from phytochemicals and listed in the International Olympic Committee
consensus statement on muscle damage evaluated by blood myofiber damage markers, muscle
soreness, performance, and inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. In this review, the effects of
dietary supplements are also discussed in terms of study design (i.e., parallel and crossover studies),
exercise model, and such subject characteristics as physical fitness level.  Future perspectives and
considerations for the use of dietary supplements to alleviate EIMD and DOMS are also discussed.

1. Introduction
Unaccustomed, strenuous high-intensity, or long-duration exercise can induce mus-
cle damage, so-called exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD). EIMD is characterized
by a primary response as a result of mechanical stress that occurs during exercise and
a secondary inflammatory response [
1,2].  Mechanical force, especially that induced by
eccentric contraction, leads to the primary response. More specifically, the overstretching
and disruption of sarcomeres, followed by increased Ca
2+
influx into the muscle cells, result
in muscle passive tension and myofibrillar disruption [3]. These responses subsequently
trigger secondary inflammatory responses, including the production of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) and cytokines, by promoting the activation of transcription factors [e.g., nu-
clear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and nuclear factor
erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)]. In addition, ROS and cytokines can be released from
neutrophils and phagocytic macrophages [4,5]. ROS and exercise-induced inflammatory
responses are essential for muscle repair, regeneration, and adaptation of redox signaling
pathways; however, if left uncontrolled, they can result in cell infiltration into the damaged
tissues, accelerating secondary muscle damage.  Consequently, EIMD appears to cause
several symptoms, such as loss of muscle function (e.g., force loss and reduced range of
motion), delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), and increased leakage of muscle proteins,

such as creatine kinase (CK), myoglobin (Mb), and aspartate transaminase (AST), into the
circulation. These symptoms can attenuate exercise performance. Therefore, it is important
to minimize these symptoms to optimize athletic performance and conditioning as well.
Several nutritional strategies have been proposed to restore muscle function, relieve
DOMS,  and  reduce  inflammation  after  exercise.   Based  on  the  International  Olympic
Committee (IOC) consensus statement on dietary supplements and high-performance
athletes, several dietary supplements, including creatine monohydrate, beta-hydroxybeta-
methylbutyrate (HMB), omega 3-fatty acids, vitamin D, gelatin, vitamin C/collagen, and
anti-inflammatory supplements, such as curcumin and tart cherry juice, may be effective
in improving training capacity, recovery, muscle soreness, and injury management [6,7].
Among these supplements, anti-inflammatory supplements may attenuate DOMS [
8,9].
Reduced  DOMS  may  be  important  in  sports  activities,  wherein  soreness  may  impair
performance in a subsequent bout of exercise [10]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that
both inflammatory responses and ROS and free radicals produced during and following
exercise may be involved in DOMS [11].  Thus, nutrition-based interventions targeting
post-exercise inflammation and/or oxidative stress responses have received much attention.
However, few supplements are considered effective [12].
When interpreting research outcomes, the study design needs to be carefully consid-
ered. The aforementioned IOC consensus statement notes that:
“the gold standard for investigating the effects of supplements on sports performance is
the prospective, randomized, controlled scientific trial, in which subjects are randomly
allocated to receive either an experimental or placebo treatment (ideally in a double-blind
manner) or crossed over to receive both treatments in counterbalanced order, under
standardized conditions”[6].
The effects of supplements can be minimal, and it is therefore necessary to select a proper
study design. In particular, since EIMD markers, including DOMS and CK exhibit large
inter-individual differences [
13,14], the study design needs to be carefully considered to
detect small effects of supplements.  In a parallel design, an appropriately large sample
size should be selected.  Furthermore, individual characteristics, especially fitness level
and training history, should be carefully considered. On the other hand, the influence of
inter-individual differences can be eliminated by employing a crossover design, though care
should be taken to eliminate or minimize the repeated bout effect, which is the adaptation
whereby a single bout of eccentric exercise protects against muscle damage from subsequent
eccentric bouts.  For example, after testing one limb for the first assessment, testing the
contralateral limb for the second assessment would minimize the repeated bout effect.
It should also be noted that when employing a contralateral exercise model,  a longer
washout period between the first and second measurements is required to minimize the
contralateral repeated bout effect, which exerts a protective effect on the contralateral
limb [15]. Moreover, testing trained individuals would be effective in minimizing repeated
bout effect after exercise with submaximal intensity or sport-specific exercises [16,17].
In addition to study designs (i.e., parallel and crossover designs), the exercise model
and physical fitness level should also be considered when interpreting supplement effects
on EIMD. Regarding the exercise model, CK activity, which is an index of muscle fiber
damage, was remarkably increased with a local muscle contraction model that accompanies
eccentric exercises, such as drop jump, calf-raise, leg press, and arm curl.  In addition, a
greater degree of damage is associated with upper-limb exercise than with lower-limb
exercise when matching the relative exercise intensity. However, elevations in inflammatory
markers, such as cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, IL-10) and ROS, in response to local muscle
contraction are relatively small, whereas whole-body exercises, such as endurance running
and cycling, can greatly elevate these markers [18,19]. As for fitness level, trained individu-
als have less muscle damage than untrained individuals, despite both groups performing
total-work matched exercise [20].
This review summarizes the supplementation strategies used to prevent and attenuate
EIMD and DOMS in humans, with a focus on dietary supplements that are introduced in

the IOC consensus statement and that have anti-inflammatory and/or antioxidant effects:
(1) curcumin; (2) tart cherry juice; (3) beetroot juice, and (4) quercetin.  Moreover, as an
emerging new supplement, (5) isothiocyanate is also discussed.  The potential effects of
study design, exercise model, and physical fitness level are discussed. Additionally, future
perspectives and considerations for the use of dietary supplements to alleviate EIMD and
DOMS are also discussed.
2. Curcumin
Curcumin  (Curcuma longaL.)  is  a  natural  polyphenolic  substance  extracted  from
turmeric.  Curcumin has various physiological effects, and its underlying mechanisms
have long been assessed in the field of clinical medicine. The major physiological effects of
curcumin are anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects [9], and responses occur through
a decrease in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes.  Therefore, curcumin has been
shown to cure various diseases, including cancer, heart failure, and Alzheimer’s demen-
tia [
21–23].  In addition, curcumin exerts analgesic effects on acute and chronic pain by
de-sensitizing the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1, an ion channel responsible for
pain sensation, thereby reducing pain sensitivity [24,25]. Curcumin also regulates inflam-
matory cascades, such as NF-κB and Nrf2 pathways [26], and therefore possibly limits
post-exercise inflammation, which subsequently reduces pain sensitivity and DOMS. As
curcumin can act as a strong free radical scavenger [27], it may reduce secondary muscle
damage. Therefore, in the IOC consensus statement, curcumin is classified as a nutritional
supplement that may improve training capacity, recovery, muscle soreness, and injury man-
agement [6]. Regarding the antioxidant effect of curcumin after exercise, Takahashi et al.
(2014) reported that curcumin ingestion lowers derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites
(d-ROMs), thioredoxin-1 (TRX-1), and glutathione (GSH), whereas it increases biological
antioxidant potential (BAP) after treadmill walking or running at 65% VO
2max
[28]. Chilelli
et al. (2016) reported that the reduction of endogenous advanced glycation end products
(AGEs) and malondialdehyde (MDA) was observed with curcumin ingestion in trained
cyclists [
29]. Notably, the bioavailability of curcumin was very low. Piperine, the active
component of black pepper, can increase the bioavailability of curcumin when piperine and
curcumin are co-ingested [30]. Microparticulation and surface treatment techniques have
also been shown to enhance the bioavailability of curcumin [31,32]. Previous paralleled
and crossover design studies that examined the effect of curcumin on EIMD and DOMS
markers are summarized below (Table1).
2.1. Paralleled Design Studies
Drobnic et al. (2014) reported that moderately active individuals who ingested cur-
cumin (4 days, 200 mg/day) exhibited lower IL-8 and DOMS in the lower limbs 2 h after
a downhill running compared to the control condition, without differences in serum CK
activity and oxidative stress markers [33].  Tanabe et al.  (2019) reported that 7-day pre-
exercise curcumin intake (180 mg/day) did not modulate maximum voluntary isometric
contraction (MVIC) torque or range of motion (ROM) following eccentric contractions
of the elbow flexors relative to the placebo intake.  However, they reported that 3-day
post-exercise curcumin intake (180 mg/day) improved the recovery of ROM and muscle
soreness compared with the placebo intake [34]. This indicates that post-exercise curcumin
intake may provide more beneficial effects in terms of reducing ROM and muscle soreness.
More recently, Faria et al. (2020) demonstrated that long-term curcumin ingestion (29 days,
1500 mg/day) resulted in a lower Mb concentration and a greater increase in IL-10 follow-
ing the half-marathon race compared with the placebo ingestion [35], suggesting that some
anti-inflammatory mechanisms were induced by curcumin in EIMD.

2.2. Crossover Design Studies
Nicol et al. (2015) reported that curcumin ingestion (5 days, 5 g/day) decreased CK
and IL-6 concentrations after leg press resistance exercise relative to the placebo ingested
condition [36].  In this study, curcumin ingestion resulted in reductions in pain and an
improvement in muscle performance, as assessed by an increase in jump height during
single-leg squats 24 and 48 h after eccentric single-leg press exercise in physically active
individuals. Tanabe et al. (2015) demonstrated that curcumin intake 1 h before and 12 h
after eccentric exercise of the elbow flexors (each 150 mg) attenuated the reduction in
MVIC torque and an increase in serum CK activity in untrained men, without modulating
IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α), and other markers (DOMS, ROM, and upper-arm
circumference) [31].   Delecroix et al.   (2017) assessed responses in elite rugby players,
demonstrating that 4-day (2 days before and 2 days after exercise) curcumin ingestion (6 g
curcumin and 60 mg piperin) attenuated reductions in power output during repetitive
sprint in comparison to the placebo condition, with no effect on DOMS and CK [30]. Tanabe
et al. (2019) reported that pre-exercise curcumin ingestion (7 days, 180 mg/day) attenuated
increases in IL-8 after elbow flexor exercise, but this response was not observed when
curcumin was administered post-exercise (7 days, 180 mg/day) compared to the placebo
ingestion condition. However, post-exercise curcumin ingestion attenuated elevations in
CK, muscle soreness, and reductions in MVIC torque of the elbow flexors and ROM of
the elbow joint [37]. Markers of oxidative stress (i.e., d-ROMs) and oxidative elimination
ability (i.e., BAP) did not change over the course of the experiment.
2.3. Summary
Irrespective of paralleled [33–35] or crossover [30,31,36,37] design, previous studies
demonstrated that curcumin ingestion attenuates some inflammatory responses, as as-
sessed by IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and/or IL-10, regardless of exercise modalities (e.g., aerobic
or resistance exercise) [33,35–37]. Based on previous studies (Table1), starting curcumin
intake at least 2 days prior to exercise appears to be necessary for reducing inflammatory
responses, regardless of the type of exercise. Regarding the antioxidant effect on responses
associated with muscle-damaging exercise, only two studies are available (one for parallel
study design [33] and the other for crossover design [37]), suggesting that no measurable
antioxidant effect of curcumin is detected after downhill running [33] and upper arm eccen-
tric exercise [37]. Regarding DOMS, due to the analgesic effects of curcumin [38], positive
effects were observed in the parallel design [33,34], whereas the results were equivocal for
the crossover design, such that two studies reported positive effects [36,37] while the other
two reported no effects [30,31].  Given that a previous study reported no effects in elite
rugby players [
30], the effect of curcumin on attenuating DOMS might be diminished in
elite or highly trained athletes. Moreover, DOMS was alleviated only when curcumin was
administered consecutively after exercise [34,37]. Thus, continuous ingestion of curcumin
during the post-exercise period might be necessary to attenuate DOMS. Regarding the per-
formance markers, positive effects were observed in parallel design [34] and all crossover
design [30,31,36,37] studies, including MVIC [31,37], jump height [36], and sprint [30].
However, the effect of curcumin on ROM is ambiguous[31,34,37], and no effect has been
reported on swelling [31,36,37].
3. Tart Cherry or Tart Cherry Juice
Tart cherry juice, made from tart Montmorency cherries, contains numerous phyto-
chemicals, including anthocyanins and flavonoids [
39]. Anthocyanins with high antiox-
idant content are thought to scavenge ROS and limit ROS production [
40].  Tart cherry
juice has been shown to lower the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases [
41]. An-
thocyanins  and  flavonoids  in  the  tart  cherry  juice  can  inhibit  enzyme  activities,  such
as cycrooxigenage-2 (COX-2) and phospholipase A2,  and may ultimately exhibit anti-
inflammatory effects [
42,43]. Therefore, tart cherry juice may better maintain the inflam-
matory response and redox balance,  thereby improving recovery following strenuous
149

Nutrients2022,14,70
exercise [44].  The IOC consensus statement mentions that the anti-inflammatory effects
of tart cherry juice may be beneficial in promoting recovery, although benefits may be
sport/training-specific. The dose of tart cherry juice needed to promote recovery appears
to be 250–350 mL (30 mL if concentrated) twice daily for 4–5 days before an athletic event
or for 2–3 days afterwards.  Moreover, the amount of tart cherry juice intake, especially
total phenolic content, is a key factor that determines its effects.  A recent review article
concluded that enhancing recovery following muscle damage via antioxidant and anti-
inflammatory mechanisms may require >1000 mg polyphenols per day for 3 or more days
prior to and following exercise [45]. Review articles concluded that tart cherry juice may
attenuate inflammatory and oxidative responses to EIMD, ultimately accelerating faster
recovery after bouts of muscle-damaging exercise [46,47]. Previous paralleled and crossover
design studies that examined the effect of tart cherry juice on EIMD and DOMS markers
are summarized below (Table2).
3.1. Paralleled Design Studies
Howatson et al. (2010) reported that 236 mL of tart cherry juice ingested twice per day
for 8 days attenuated decreased MVIC and inflammatory markers [IL-6, C-reactive protein
(CRP)] after marathon running in recreational runners [39].  Moreover, total antioxidant
status (TAS) was greater and oxidative stress, as assessed by thiobarbituric acid reactive
species  (TBARS),  was  lower  in  the  tart  cherry  juice  group  than  in  the  placebo  group.
Bell et al. (2016) reported that individuals who ingested tart cherry juice (8 days, 30 mL
twice/day) exhibited lower IL-6 and DOMS in the lower limbs and a faster recovery of knee
extensor MVIC, CMJ, and agility after the Loughborough intermittent shuttle test (LIST)
compared to the control group, without differences in serum CK activity and oxidative
stress marker (LOOH) in semi-professional male soccer players [48]. Recently, Quinlan et al.
(2019) reported that tart cherry juice (8 days, 30 mL twice/day) accelerated the recovery of
CMJ, 20-m sprint, and MVIC of knee extensors following LIST compared to the placebo
conditions in team sports players (football, hockey, or netball sports) [49]. In contrast, Lamb
et al.  (2019) demonstrated that 9-day tart cherry juice ingestion (30 mL twice/day) had
no effects on MVIC, DOMS, CK, or ROM after the elbow flexors of the non-dominant arm
exercise relative to the placebo drink ingestion group in non-resistant trained men [50].
3.2. Crossover Design Studies
Connolly et al. (2006) reported that 355 mL of tart cherry juice twice/day (for 8 days)
ingestion attenuated decreased MVIC and DOMS after eccentric exercise of the elbow
flexors in college students [
51].  On the other hand, in well-trained male, Bowtell et al.
(2011) reported that 30 mL twice/day (for 10 days) ingestion attenuated reductions in
MVIC and increases in protein carbonyls without affecting CK, CRP, DOMS, and other
antioxidant status markers (nitrotyrosine and TAS) after knee extensions [52]. Meanwhile,
in professional athletes, Morehen et al.  (2020) reported that 8-day tart cherry juice con-
sumption (30 mL twice/day) had no effect on cytokine responses (IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10),
DOMS, or jump performance (CMJ and drop jump) after professional league matches in
rugby players compared with the placebo [53]. Similarly, Abbott et al. (2020) reported no
effects of tart cherry juice ingestion (2 shots×30 mL, before and after the match, 12 and
36 h after the match) on muscle function (CMJ and reactive strength index), self-reported
well-being, and muscle soreness after a 90-min soccer match in male professional soccer
players in comparison to the control group [54].

3.3. Summary
Irrespective of the study design, mixed results have been reported regarding the effects
on exercise performance.  Among these, positive effects were reported for the types of
markers assessed in MVIC [
39,48,49,51,52], CMJ [48,49], and sprint [49].  As for DOMS,
most studies reported no effects in both parallel [
39,49,50] and crossover [52–54] studies;
however, some studies also reported positive effects [48,51], regardless of the study design.
The effects of tart cherry on inflammatory (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and CRP) and oxidative stress
(TAS, TBARS, LOOH, nitrotyrosine,  and protein carbonyls) markers are not universal
in parallel studies [
39,48,49].  However, in crossover studies, no effect was detected on
inflammatory markers [
52,53], but protein carbonyls, an oxidative stress marker, were
reduced [52]. No effect of tart cherry juice was consistently observed on muscle damage
markers in blood (CK and LDH), regardless of a parallel [39,48–50] or crossover [52] study
design.   Notably,  two crossover studies reported no effect on professional soccer [54]
or rugby [
53] players.  Thus, the effect of tart cherry on indices associated with EIMD
and DOMS may be diminished in elite or highly trained individuals.  In addition, the
aforementioned crossover studies assessed responses before and after match play, which
would mediate less muscle damage relative to laboratory-based exercise loads, such as
eccentric exercise. Therefore, the effect of tart cherry juice might be hardly detectable under
conditions where sport-specific exercises, such as soccer and rugby match, are employed.
In the future, studies will be needed to delineate the optimal amount and duration of tart
cherry juice intake in terms of the effect on DOMS in athletes.
4. Beetroot Juice
Red beetroot (Beta vulgaris rubra) is a functional food that contains high levels of nitrate
and other phytochemicals, including bioactive compounds, such as betalain, ascorbic acid,
carotenoids, phenolic acids, and flavonoids. Chronic and acute beetroot juice supplemen-
tation has been shown to improve blood pressure control, vascular function, and renal
health [55]. Nitrate in the beetroot juice increases nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, which
subsequently improves vascular function, mitochondrial efficiency, glucose homoeostasis,
and muscle contractility of type II fibers, thereby improving exercise performance [56],
especially endurance exercise performance (in the range of 5–30 min) [57]. Therefore, nitrate
is classified as a nutritional supplement that directly improves sports performance in the
IOC consensus statement [6]. Moreover, beetroot juice may improve sprint and cognitive
performance [58]. As for the timing of ingestion, beetroot juice needs to be ingested at least
90 min prior to the event [59].  On the other hand, betalain, the most potent antioxidant
molecule found in beetroot, is thought to attenuate ROS scavenging and upregulate en-
dogenous antioxidant enzymes. Nitrites have also been shown to inhibit radical formation
and ROS production. Moreover, betalain is responsible for its analgesic effects via an anti-
inflammatory related mechanism [60]. Therefore, beetroot juice is expected to accelerate
the recovery of muscle damage by directly or indirectly reducing exercise-induced ROS
production and DOMS. Previous paralleled and crossover design studies that examined
the effect of beetroot juice on EIMD and DOMS markers are summarized below (Table3).
4.1. Paralleled Design Studies
Clifford et al. assessed the effect of beetroot juice on EIMD and DOMS in a series of
studies [61–64]. They examined the acute effect of beetroot juice [a higher dose (250 mL,
~250 mg of nitrate) and a lower dose (125 mL, the same composition as the higher dose
beetroot juice, but provided half the dose)], and an isocaloric placebo drink (250 mL, with
negligible nitrate content) consumed immediately (×3 bottles), 24 h (×2 bottles), and 48 h
(×2 bottles) after 100-drop jumps in 30 physically active men. In this study, regardless of
dosage, beetroot juice supplementation attenuated DOMS at 24, 48, and 72 h post-exercise,
and reduced CMJ performance 72 h post-exercise. However, there were no significant dif-
ferences in any of the cytokines assessed (IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-8) regardless of the amount
of beetroot juice ingested [62].  Using the same drop jump protocol, a subsequent study
152

Nutrients2022,14,70
by Clifford and colleagues reported that DOMS evaluated by pressure pain-threshold
following 100-drop jumps was attenuated by beetroot juice ingestion (~210 mg of nitrate)
compared to NO
3
−
dose-matched sodium nitrate drink or placebo drink. Therefore, beet-
root juice supplementation is more effective than sodium nitrate in attenuating DOMS
associated with EIMD. The authors concluded that phytonutrients other than nitrate, such
as betalains and phenolics, or interactions between them (or with nitrate), are likely re-
sponsible for its analgesic effects [
64]. Clifford et al. also examined the effect of beetroot
juice using two bouts of repeated-sprint exercise models [63]. In this study, beetroot juice
ingestion (2×250 mL/day, ~251 mg/bottle of nitrate, 4 days) attenuated DOMS evaluated
by pressure pain threshold and reductions in CMJ performance relative to placebo inges-
tion condition. However, beetroot juice did not affect the indirect oxidative stress markers
(LOOH and protein carbonyls) and a direct marker of free radical production (ascorbyl
free radical).  Moreover, the same research group reported no effect of beetroot juice on
responses after the marathon race [
61].  Specifically,  total blood leukocyte,  neutrophil,
and monocyte counts peaked immediately after marathon race, and responses did not
return to pre-marathon values at day 2 post-marathon in both beetroot juice [total 6 bottles
(250 mL/bottle, ~210 mg of nitrate) 3 days post-marathon] and an isocaloric placebo groups.
Furthermore, the responses of cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-
α), CK, AST, CRP, and muscle
soreness were not different between the two groups. Thus, beetroot juice does not appear
to modulate inflammation or reduce muscle damage after prolonged endurance exercise.
4.2. Crossover Design Studies
Van Hoorebeke et al. (2016) reported that betalain-rich supplementation (100 mg/day
for 6 days before the exercise trials and 50 mg on day 7), containing no sugars or nitrates,
improved 5-km time trial performance and attenuated elevations in LDH from baseline
compared to placebo ingestion in young competitive runners [65]. Montenegro et al. (2017),
under  similar  supplementation  conditions  (dose  and  ingestion  timing),  reported  that
betalain-rich supplementation improved 10-km running time trial performance and 5-km
time trial performance (performed 24 h after the 10-km time trial), as well as attenuating
increased CK in competitive male and female triathletes [66]. Daab et al. (2020) reported
that 7-day beetroot juice supplementation (2×150 mL/day, 3 days pre-exercise, day of
test, and 3 days after intermittent damaging exercise) reduced muscle soreness and LDH,
and improved the recovery of muscle function (CMJ, MVIC) after intermittent damaging
exercise in soccer players [67].
Recently,  although the order of intervention was not counterbalanced,  long-term
(4 weeks) beetroot juice supplementation (26 g/day freeze-dried beetroot) increased lipid
peroxidation (i.e., MDA) in elite fencers. This result is unexpected because beetroot juice
can decrease oxidative stress. The authors of a previous study speculated that beetroot juice
consumption might have increased physical activity, ultimately increasing oxidative stress.
Additionally, a significant increase in VO
2max
was observed after ingestion of beetroot juice
without attenuated muscle damage markers, such as CK and LDH [68].

4.3. Summary
One parallel study showed no effect on oxidative stress [63], whereas one crossover
study showed that beetroot juice increased oxidative stress [68]. Previous studies demon-
strated that beetroot juice had no effect on inflammatory responses (IL-6, IL-8, CRP, and
TNF-α) following exercise modalities (sprint, plyometric, intermittent, and endurance exer-
cise) regardless of parallel [61–64] or crossover [67,68] study design. From these results, it
is thought that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of beetroot juice after exercise
may be minimal based on the blood indices.  However, blood markers may not directly
reflect muscle conditions.  Therefore, it remains to be elucidated whether beetroot juice
modulate oxidative and inflammatory responses in muscles. Muscle pain, as measured by
changes in pressure pain threshold, is alleviated by beetroot juice supplementation in a
parallel study design; however, these studies by Clifford et al. did not employ a crossover
study design. Muscle damage markers in blood, such as CK and AST, were not affected
by beetroot juice intake in all parallel design studies wherein a drop jump, sprint, and
marathon race were employed [
61–64]. However, the CK and LDH levels were elevated
following intense running or cycling, which was attenuated by beetroot juice intake in
some crossover design studies [65–67]. Together, these findings suggest that the effect of
beetroot juice on blood muscle damage indices is highly dependent on the study design,
and crossover design studies suggest that beetroot juice may reduce muscle damage caused
by endurance exercise. Meanwhile, most crossover studies have found that beetroot juice
supplementation promotes faster recovery of sprint [67], CMJ [67], MVIC [67], time trial
duration [
65,66] and VO
2max
[68] after muscle damage exercise.  Furthermore, approxi-
mately half of the previous studies employing parallel designs detected positive effects
on the aforementioned performance indices [62,63]. A possible reason for this improved
performance may be related to increased electromyography amplitude during maximal iso-
metric voluntary contractions, the improvement of neuromuscular efficiency, and improved
cardiorespiratory performance, as suggested in a previous study [69,70], independent of
muscle damage conditions. Therefore, the consumption of beetroot juice may be effective
in improving the performance even under EIMD conditions.
5. Quercetin
Quercetin  is  a  plant  flavonoid  found  in  green  tea,  red  and  white  onions,  apples,
peppers,  blueberries,  and dark green vegetables.   Quercetin has antioxidant and anti-
inflammatory properties, as well as cardioprotective, anticancer, and hepatoprotective
effects [71]. In addition, quercetin has antipathogenic activities [72] which may influence
immune system and resistance to pathogens.  Therefore, quercetin is classified as a nu-
tritional supplement for immune health in athletes in the IOC consensus statement [
6].
On the other hand, quercetin may possess potent antioxidant activity, as demonstrated in
animal studies [73]. Moreover, studies usingin vitromodels demonstrated that quercetin
attenuated the expression of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-1β
transcripts in cultured human macrophages [74].  Human studies using a prolonged en-
durance exercise model (i.e., treadmill running or cycling) reported that chronic (3 weeks)
pure quercetin supplementation did not protect against exercise-induced oxidative stress
and inflammation [75]. However, when quercetin was consumed for 2 weeks alongside
the co-ingestion of other components (e.g., epigallocatechin 3-gallate), supplementation
was found to counteract inflammation [
76]. In contrast, even if quercetin was combined
with other components, acute (15 min before exercise) supplementation did not attenuate
post-exercise inflammation [77]. Thus, the effect of quercetin appears to vary depending
on the duration of intake and/or if another nutritional supplement is co-ingested. More
recently, a study testing triathletes demonstrated that a quercetin supplement designed
especially to increase quercetin bioavailability may reduce oxidative stress (i.e., d-ROMs)
and muscle pain immediately after training, with an improvement in the total time in
all the three single events (swim, bike and run) simulating a triathlon race [
78].  Thus,
any approach that increases the bioavailability of quercetin is important for increasing its
155

Nutrients2022,14,70
effectiveness. Previous paralleled and crossover design studies that examined the effect of
quercetin on EIMD and DOMS markers are summarized below (Table4).
5.1. Paralleled Design Studies
Askari et al. (2012) showed that an 8-week supplementation of 500 mg/day quercetin
combined with 200 mg/day vitamin C reduced plasma CK activity in male students [79].
In addition, Martin-Rincon et al. (2020) reported that a single dose of 140 mg mango leaf
extract (Zynamite
®
) combined with 140 mg quercetin ingested one hour before 10-km
running competition plus 100 drop jumps, followed by three additional doses (every 8 h
thereafter for 24 h) attenuated muscle pain and the loss of jumping performance 24 h
later compared with the placebo ingestion group in physically active male and female
students [
80].  In this study, the increases in the muscle damage marker in blood (Mb)
following exercise were attenuated by quercetin supplementation in males only. Although
CRP increased 24 h after exercise, quercetin supplementation had no effect on CRP at any
point.  On the other hand, O’Fallon et al.  (2012) reported that 1000 mg/day (for 7 days
before and 5 days after exercise) quercetin supplementation had no effect on markers of
muscle damage (CK, muscle strength, soreness, resting arm angle, and upper arm swelling)
or inflammation (IL-6 and CRP) after 24 eccentric exercises of the elbow flexors [81].
5.2. Crossover Design Studies
Bazzucchi et al. (2019) demonstrated the effect of 14-day quercetin supplementation
(1000 mg/day) on neuromuscular impairment before, during, and after eccentric exercise
of the elbow flexors in young active males [82]. Before exercise, quercetin supplementation
increased isometric strength during MVIC compared to the baseline. During the eccentric
exercise, the torque and muscle fiber conduction velocity decay were smaller in quercetin
than in placebo ingestion. Immediately after exercise, isometric strength, the force–velocity
relationship, and muscle fiber conduction velocity were lower in the placebo condition
than in the quercetin ingestion condition. The authors concluded that quercetin supplemen-
tation seems to attenuate the severity of muscle weakness by sarcolemmal action potential
propagation impairment [82].  A subsequent study by the same group using a similar
design (the same quercetin dose, duration, and exercise protocol) demonstrated that 14-day
quercetin supplementation (1000 mg/day) attenuated the increase in biomarkers of muscle
damage (CK and LDH) associated with eccentric exercise [83]. Regarding these results, the
authors speculated that 14 days of quercetin supplementation might have reduced lipid
peroxidation and improved the redox status, ultimately increasing membrane resistance to
mechanical stress [83].

5.3. Summary
Quercetin ingestion does not provide anti-inflammatory effects after neither endurance
nor local (e.g., elbow flexors and drop jumps) exercise in a parallel study design [
80,81]. No
crossover study has been conducted regarding the anti-inflammatory effects of quercetin.
Several studies in which muscle damage was not assessed reported that quercetin supple-
mentation enhances endurance exercise performance or anaerobic capacity as a result of
improvement of mitochondrial biogenesis and antagonizing adenosine receptors [84,85].
In addition, quercetin may attenuate muscle strength loss following eccentric exercise or
running [80,82,83] regardless of the research design. This ergogenic effect of quercetin may
reflect an improvement of action potential propagation impairment due to the fact that the
Ca
2+
released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum or a blocking effect on the adenosine recep-
tors, which may influence motor unit recruitment capacity. Most previous studies reported
that quercetin attenuates muscle damage as assessed by blood markers (CK, LDH, and Mb),
regardless of the study design, and independent of the physical activity [79,80,82,83]. The
effect of quercetin on DOMS has been shown to be effective in a parallel study only [80];
thus, future crossover studies are warranted. The timing of quercetin intake may need to
be considered because of the short half-life of quercetin (3.5 h) [86]. In addition, a clear anti-
inflammatory effect has been reported in studies wherein quercetin was co-ingested with
isoquercetin, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic
acid), and epigallocatechin 3-gallate [76]. As described in the aforementioned studies, a de-
creasing effect of quercetin on blood markers of muscle damage (CK and Mb) was observed
when quercetin was co-ingested with vitamin C [79] or mango leaf extract [80]. Therefore,
to maximize the effect of quercetin, the ingestion of additional nutritional supplements or
the timing of quercetin intake may be important.
6. Isothiocyanate
All of the supplements reviewed herein, namely curcumin, tart cherry juice, beet-
root juice,  and quercetin,  were classified as phenolic compounds.  On the other hand,
isothiocyanate, which is classified as an organosulfur compound, is an emerging phy-
tochemical [
87].  Isothiocyanate is found in vegetables,  including those of theBrassica
(Cruciferous) genus.  For example, benzyl isothiocyanate and phenethyl isothiocyanate
are found in cabbage and watercress, whereas sulforaphane is found in broccoli.  Allyl
isothiocyanate and 6-methylsulfinylhexyl isothiocyanate (6-MSITC) are present in wasabi
(Wasabia japonica) which is a typical Japanese pungent spice. These compounds have car-
dioprotective and anticarcinogenic effects [88].  The common actions of isothiocyanate
in organosulfur compounds have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects [
87,89,90].
Therefore, isothiocyanate supplementation is expected to accelerate the recovery of EIMD
and DOMS. However, very limited research regarding the effectiveness of isothiocyanate
in improving EIMD is available in animal studies. 6-MSITC, a type of isothiocyanate, is
known to be a potent Nrf2 activator and suppresses all three MAPK pathways, exhibiting
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties [91,92]. In addition to these characteristics,
a previous work reported that 6-MSITC might suppress calpain-1 activation, which is a
Ca
2+
-dependent protease [93], in the muscle tissue.  Moreover, the same study demon-
strated that 6-MSITC administration attenuates CK activity after forced swimming in
mice [
94].  The inhibition of calpain activity accelerates the force production restoration
process after eccentric contractions in rats [95]. Based on these results obtained in animal
studies, 6-MSITC intake is expected to accelerate the recovery process of reduced maximum
muscle contraction after eccentric exercise in humans. A pilot study using a randomized,
double-blind, crossover design examined the effect of 5-day 6-MSITC supplementation
(9 mg/day) on EIMD and DOMS after eccentric exercise of the elbow flexors in young
active males. In contrast to the hypothesis, calpain-1, muscle damage (MVIC torque, ROM,
DOMS, CK, and swelling), and inflammatory markers (IL-8 and TNF-α) were not affected
by 6-MSITC relative to those in the placebo-treated condition [96]. Given that this is the
158

Nutrients2022,14,70
only human study assessing the effect of 6-MSITC, more human studies are needed to
delineate the effectiveness of isothiocyanate in humans in the future.
7. Conclusions
7.1. Remarks
In the current review, dietary supplements with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant
effects are discussed. Some positive effects mediated by curcumin, tart cherry juice, beetroot
juice, and quercetin have been reported in EIMD and DOMS, although some of these results
are not consistent among previous studies. These supplements may not only attenuate the
aggravation of secondary muscle damage, but also improve performance by modulating
cardiorespiratory and neuromuscular efficiency possibly in an interactive manner. It should
be highlighted that exercise modality, physical fitness level, and study design need to be
considered when interpreting the results of supplementation effects.  Furthermore, the
dose and duration of supplementation are important factors to maximize the effect of
supplementation on EIMD and DOMS.
7.2. Future Perspectives
When using dietary supplements in competition or daily training to attenuate EIMD
or  DOMS,  it  is  advisable  for  all  individuals,  including  athletes,  coaches,  and  experts,
to interpret research outcomes.  The dietary supplements presented in this review are
included in the IOC consensus statements for high-performance athletes; however, the
evidence is still limited and not well established for EIMD and DOMS. Moreover, we
were unable to determine an appropriate dose and duration for each supplement for
attenuating EIMD and DOMS, as the bioavailability and half-life of supplements can vary
depending on their purification methods and forms. More studies are required to draw a
firm conclusion regarding appropriate dose and duration. Moreover, further research is
needed to identify the effectiveness of dietary supplements for EIMD and DOMS, especially
in elite athletes [97].
In addition, we need to understand the differences between natural vs. purified prod-
ucts. We may need to take a large amount of natural products to increase the bioavailability
necessary to attenuate EIMD and DOMS. It is also important to note that natural products
may contain non-target ingredients which might modulate the action of supplements.
Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention not only to the amount but also to the form
of products.

Abstract:Athletes represent a major part of dietary supplement users. This scoping review aims to
explore the prevalence of dietary supplement use among athletes worldwide, most commonly used
supplements, sources of information on dietary supplements and their reasons for use of these sup-
plements. PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and PsycInfo were searched for original research articles.
Studies were included if they involved athletes, identified the prevalence of dietary supplement use,
and were published after 2017. A total of 26 articles were reviewed. Prevalence of dietary supplement
use varied among articles, but sex-based differences related to the types of used dietary supplements
existed. Generally, the findings were consistent in terms of reasons for use and sources of information.
Unfortunately, the lack of homogeneity regarding the definition of dietary supplements, definition
of use, reporting timeframes, and data collection methods complicates the attempt to compare the
findings among studies.
Keywords:

1. Introduction
Natural health products, often referred to as dietary supplements, are naturally oc-
curring substances intended to supplement the diet to restore or maintain good health [1].
These commercially available substances include, but are not limited to, proteins, herbs,
botanicals, vitamins, and minerals [
2]. The absence of consensus on a clear definition or
categorization of dietary supplements [
3–6] can complicate the attempts to provide an
accurate overview of the current state of prevalence, posing multiple challenges to the
interpretation of relevant research [7]. For example, the International Olympic Committee
Consensus Statement defined dietary supplements as, “A food, food component, nutrient,
or non-food compound that is purposefully ingested in addition to the habitually consumed
diet with the aim of achieving a specific health and/or performance benefit”, [8], and the
National Institutes of Health defines dietary supplements as, “A product that is intended
to supplement the diet; A dietary supplement contains one or more dietary ingredients
(including vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, and other substances)
or their components; is intended to be taken by mouth as a pill, capsule, tablet, or liquid;
and is identified on the front label of the product as being a dietary supplement” [9].
Substantial research has been conducted to study the prevalence of dietary supplement
use and relevant practices around the world. Athletes were one of the most targeted groups
of interest because they represent a major part of dietary supplement users [10]. Previous
work has estimated the prevalence of dietary supplement use among athletes to be between
40% and 100%, depending on several factors including the level of competition, type of
sport, and the definition of dietary supplement use [7].
This raises the concern of dietary supplement misuse and inadvertent doping (i.e.,
when a  prohibited  substance  is  unknowingly  consumed)  as  they  can  expose  users  to
harmful substances or precursors of prohibited substances. Initiated by the International

Olympic Committee in 1999, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was established,
commencing the fight against doping in sports. Due to being classified as a subcategory of
food, manufacturers of dietary supplements are not required to provide consumers with
evidence of product safety or efficacy before marketing their products as they are exempt
from Federal Drug Administration approval [7]. This means that manufacturing companies
do not have to test their products for banned substances according to the WADA list. This
can pose great risks to athletes’ careers. For example, in September 2019, Carina Horn, a
South African Olympic athlete, failed a drug test due to contaminated supplements and
was sentenced to a 4-year ban. Luckily, Horn fought the claims against her in court and
won her case. A scientist confirmed that the prohibited substances came from supplements
Horn was consuming, more specifically, contaminated pre-and post-workout supplements.
This incident of inadvertent doping caused Horn to miss the World Championships in 2019,
and Tokyo’s Summer Olympics in 2021 [11]. Similarly, in April 2019, Brandon Copeland,
an American football linebacker, also failed a drug test due to contaminated supplements.
Though unintentional, this incident resulted in a four-game suspension and a $745 fee to
test each supplement to expose the contaminated product [12].
Contamination can occur either due to inadequate manufacturing procedures or can
be intentional by manufacturers to increase the effectiveness of their supplements [13]. The
most frequently reported undeclared contaminants of dietary supplements are anabolic-
androgenic steroids and stimulants [14], which are mostly found in supplements targeted
for enhancing athletic performance [13].  This amplifies the importance of purchasing
third-party tested supplements. These are supplements tested for their safety and purity
by third-party programs [15]. Unfortunately, many dietary supplements do not undergo
third-party testing, and therefore, dietary supplements remain a great threat to competing
athletes with the risk of contamination with doping-related substances [15].
Given that common sources of dietary supplement-related information come from
fellow teammates, coaches, the internet, family and friends or their judgment [6], an educa-
tional intervention program is a possible way to improve dietary supplement knowledge
among athletes to decrease the risk of dietary supplement misuse and inadvertent dop-
ing [
16].  Considering the many risks associated with dietary supplement consumption,
a food-first approach is often recommended to all populations when considering the use
of dietary supplements. However, it is important to understand that this approach may
not always be practical or appropriate, especially for athletes [17]. There are many reasons
why the risk-benefit analysis may favor the consumption of dietary supplements. These
include: (1) certain nutrients are difficult to consume through the diet in sufficient amounts,
(2) some nutrients are limited to food items an athlete might not eat, (3) uncertainty of the
number of ergogenic nutrients consumed due to high variability in food items, (4) larger
doses of concentrated nutrients needed to correct deficiencies or other health implications,
(5) whole foods may be impractical to consume before, during, or after physical activity and
(6) dietary supplements may help when contamination of food hygiene is a concern [17].
Therefore, Close et al. (2022), suggest ‘food first’ should mean, “where practically possible,
nutrient provision should come from whole foods and drinks rather than from isolated
food components or dietary supplements”. The International Association of Athletics Fed-
erations Consensus Statement [18] and the International Olympic Committee Consensus
Statement [8] also acknowledge that a food-first approach may not always be practical,
as the use of dietary supplements may be necessary for athletes to meet their nutritional
needs when whole food consumption is impractical due to training schedules, preparation
and storage issues and gut comfort [8,18]. Considering the emerging concerns regarding
dietary supplements’ safety, several studies have investigated their integrity and authen-
ticity.  Furthermore, the attempt to compare the prevalence of dietary supplement use
and practices worldwide might not be so accurate due to inconsistent definitions among
studies and a lack of differentiation between the general categories of dietary supplements,
which complicates the attempts to compare specific trends, especially among athletes. This
does not provide specificity to be able to compare studies on specific dietary supplements

used by athletes.  Currently, there are no recent rigorous research reviews that explore
the prevalence of supplement use among athletes. Therefore, the purpose of this scoping
review was to explore the prevalence of dietary supplement use among athletes worldwide
from 2018 to 2022, most commonly used supplements, reasons for dietary supplement use
and sources of information.
2. Materials and Methods
This scoping review was designed and conducted in accordance with the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews
(PRISMA-ScR) guidelines (Table S1—Supplementary Materials) [19]. The review protocol
can be obtained upon request from the corresponding author.
2.1. Eligibility Criteria
To be included in the review, peer-reviewed journal papers needed to (1) involve
athletes,  (2) identify the prevalence of dietary supplement use among athletes,  (3) be
published after 2017.  Studies were excluded if they (1) investigated supplement use in
gym users, (2) collected data before 2016. All the studies had to be fully completed and
published; abstract-only, presentation-only, and unpublished studies were excluded.
2.2. Information Sources
Searches were conducted on the electronic databases of PubMed, CINAHL, PsycInfo,
and MEDLINE for studies published from 2018 up until June 2022 (The last search was
conducted in July 2022). The search was restricted to papers written or translated to English.
Reference lists of all retrieved articles in addition to the profiles of authors with extensive
experience in dietary supplement research were scanned for additional relevant articles.
2.3. Search Strategy
The search strategy involved a combination of keywords including (supplement OR
product OR vitamin OR mineral OR protein OR ergogenic OR drink OR herbal OR amino
acid OR nutraceutical OR bar), AND (athlete OR player OR physically active OR elite
OR sport OR bodybuilder OR runner OR team OR football OR soccer OR swimmer OR
weightlifter OR dancer OR triathlete OR baseball OR gymnastic OR ballet OR tennis OR
sailor OR basketball OR hockey), AND (use OR consumption OR prevalence OR survey
OR pattern OR report OR intake OR habit).  The search was limited to results in which
these keywords show in the title or abstract.
2.4. Selection Process
Studies were screened for eligibility by two of the authors.  Any disagreements on
study selection or data extraction were resolved by consensus or after discussion with the
third author.
2.5. Data Charting and Items
The data charting table was developed by the first author and further improved and
approved by the other two authors to finally include the authors’ names, year of publication,
country where each study was conducted, supplements of focus, type of sport, target
population, age, sample size, data collection method, and results (prevalence of supplement
use, most commonly used supplements, reasons for use, and sources of information).
3. Results
3.1. Selection of Studies
A total of 596 studies were identified through searching databases and other sources.
After removing duplicates (n = 105), 491 articles were screened based on their titles and
abstracts only, yielding 52 studies for full-text screening. Twenty-six articles were excluded,
167

Nutrients2022,14, 4109
leaving a final pool of 26 studies that were eligible for inclusion in this scoping review
(Figure1).
Figure 1.Selection of sources of evidence.
3.2. Characteristics of Studies
Figure2represents the studies’ demographics. Studies were mostly conducted in Spain
(31%) and the United States of America (27%) [15,20–33].  Some studies investigated sup-
plement use in more than one country [
34–37].  The twenty-six studies included a total of
17,342 participants. The sample sizes ranged from 20 [26]to2113 subjects [24]. The majority of
the studies included adult athletes, some included under18 athletes [20,24,25,28,32,34,38–40],
and none included older-adult athletes. Most studies included athletes from several sport
categories [6,15,20–22,27,31,34,36–38,40], while others focused on one type of sport such as
running [23,24], bodybuilding [41,42], football [32,35], rowing [26], sailing [25], rugby [30],
fencing [28], handball [29], squash [33], and track and field [39]. Interestingly, one study
focused on paralympic sports [34].

168

Nutrients2022,14, 4109
3.3. Data Collection Methods and Reporting Timeframes
All studies used self-reported questionnaires or surveys to collect data on dietary
supplement use among athletes. Some studies have provided their questionnaire or survey
in  an  online  format  [24,27,29,32,37,40,41].   However,  the  selected  reporting  timeframe
varied across studies (Figure3).  Most of the studies investigated current use of dietary
supplements, while other timeframes were the past year (n = 7), past six months (n = 2),
past 3 months (n = 1), past month (n = 1), and past season (n = 1). None of the studies used
qualitative or mixed-methods approach to research.
 
Figure 3.Reporting timeframes across studies.
3.4. Prevalence of Dietary Supplement Use among Athletes
The characteristics of each study, prevalence of dietary supplement use and most
used dietary supplements are summarized in Table1.  It is worth highlighting that the
defined use of dietary supplements differed among studies. A large number of the stud-
ies defined use as reporting using at least one dietary supplement in the chosen time-
frame[6,15,20,21,23,29,30,35,40,43]. Other studies defined use as using at least one dietary
supplement on two or more days per week [22,24,31]. The rest of the studies did not clarify
how they defined dietary supplement use.

The prevalence of dietary supplement use is presented in Table1. The included studies
covered a wide range of individual and team sports. Most studies included athletes from
several sport categories, while others focused on one type of sport such as running, rowing,
sailing, bodybuilding, rugby, fencing, handball, football, squash, and track & field.
Prevalence ranged from 11% [37] to 100% [15,26,33]. The use of dietary supplements
among athletes was relatively high in the majority of the studies, but this can vary based
on the breadth of the definition of a dietary supplement, reporting timeframe (i.e., past
month vs.  past year), data collection method and format, and definition of dietary sup-
plement use (Table1). In general, the consumption of dietary supplements was higher in
males compared to females except for few studies [23,24,39]. Protein and vitamin/mineral
supplements were among the most commonly used supplements reported by athletes. In
most of the studies that presented the most commonly used supplements based on sex, it
was clear that females were more likely to use vitamin/mineral supplements compared to
males, while males were more likely to use protein supplements.
3.5. Reasons for Dietary Supplement Use
The reported reasons of dietary supplement use were generally consistent across stud-
ies (Table2). The most frequently reported reasons are improving athletic performance, im-
proving health, and accelerating recovery. Very few studies, among those that investigated
motivations behind dietary supplement use, presented sex-based differences [22,25,34].
Females were more likely to use dietary supplements for health reasons, while males were
more likely to report using dietary supplements to enhance performance.

3.6. Sources of Information on Dietary Supplements
Sources of information on dietary supplements were investigated in most of the studies
(Table3). Health care professionals, coaches/trainers, the internet, and teammates were
among the most commonly reported sources of information. It is apparent that males are
more likely to rely on their coach/trainer, teammates, dietitian/nutritionist, and family
and friends to receive information on dietary supplements, while females are more likely
to rely on doctors/healthcare professionals, their coach/trainer, and family & friends.

4. Discussion
The aim of this scoping review was to explore the prevalence of dietary supplement
use among athletes worldwide in the past 5 years, most commonly used supplements,
reasons for dietary supplement use and sources of information. Using rigorous scoping
review methods, 27 studies were reviewed to examine the current breadth of knowledge of
dietary supplement prevalence among athletes; no qualitative or mixed-methods studies
were found. Given the increasing consumer interest in health and well-being that is well-
reflected by the fast-growing dietary supplements industry, which is expected to reach
around USD 278 billion by 2024, it is vital to examine the prevalence of dietary supplement
use among athletes [44]. In this current review, the prevalence ranged between 11% [37]
to 100% [
15,26,33].  In general, the prevalence of dietary supplement consumption was
higher in males compared to females except for few studies [23,24,39]. Additionally, there
was minimal reporting on age-based differences, however few studies noted age as an
influence on dietary supplement consumption, with older athletes consuming more dietary
supplements than younger ones [20,27,39].
Currently, there is no universal definition of dietary supplements used within the
scientific community, therefore, the definition used to define dietary supplements varied
across studies. The broadness of definitions used to describe dietary supplements by studies
affect their findings’ comparability with other studies that define dietary supplements
differently.  Many authors studying this subject area also noted difficulty in comparing
studies due to the lack of homogeneity between definitions and categorizations of dietary
supplements [2,7]. The absence of a standard definition for dietary supplements creates
an issue within the scientific community to accurately study trends between the results of
different studies.
Furthermore,  it  is  important  to  note  that  the  reported  prevalence  by  each  study
included  in  this  review  heavily  relied  on  how  they  defined  dietary  supplement  use.
While some studies defined it as using at least one dietary supplement in a chosen time-
frame [
6,15,20,21,23,29,30,35,40,43], others defined it as using at least one dietary supple-
ment on two or more days per week [
22,24,31]. The remaining studies did not explicitly
define dietary supplement use. Along with inconsistencies between defined dietary sup-
plement use among studies, inconsistencies between used time frames also complicates the
attempt to compare the prevalence of dietary supplement use among athletes. Current use
of dietary supplements, use of dietary supplements in the past year, past six months, three
months, past month, and past season were all timeframes used by studies. Similarly, lack of
consistent methodology also hinders researcher ’s ability to compare studies. Interestingly,
some studies have used online questionnaires/surveys to explore dietary supplement use,
and all of these were conducted after 2019, which implies how the COVID-19 pandemic
has affected this type of research, and might shape the format of similar future studies.

Most studies in this review focused on a wide range of dietary supplements, while
only one focused on a specific dietary supplement such as tart cherry [
37].  A possible
reason dietary supplements may seem attractive to athletes is that they are continuously
seeking ways to gain advantages over their competitors.  Based on the studies included
in this review,  it appears the main reasons for dietary supplement use are improving
athletic performance,  improving health,  and accelerating recovery.   Fascinatingly,  one
study included in this review surveyed the attitudes of athletes who refrain from dietary
supplement use, with the main reasoning being that they do not need them, and that
they do not know enough about them [
34].  In the few studies that examined sex-based
differences, it was concluded that females were more likely to consume dietary supplements
for health reasons and males were more likely to consume dietary supplements to enhance
performance [22,25,34]. Another sex-based difference one study found is that females often
used dietary supplements ‘at times’ rather than on a regular basis [43]. Potential false and
misleading advertisement by companies in the dietary supplement industry coupled with
lack of knowledge put athletes at great risk of inadvertent doping [32]. It is alarming that
there is a large number of studies in which athletes reported that they rely on their coaches,
teammates, the internet or family and friends for information on dietary supplements.
Referring to a reliable source of information with regard to dietary supplements is critical
in the athletic community, considering the probability of supplement contamination with
prohibited substances and consequent health risks and anti-doping sanctions.
Determining the prevalence of doping amongst athletes was not within the scope of
this review.  However, considering the great risk of dietary supplement contamination
with prohibited substances, athletes should consider all other options before obtaining
nutrients from dietary supplements [7]. Consuming nutrients from whole foods provides
greater benefits than the consumption of isolated nutrients [45].  Dietary supplements
cannot excuse inadequate diets, and therefore, it is recommended that athletes optimize
and prioritize their nutrient intake from whole foods. Of course, dietary supplement use
cannot be fully disputed as there are circumstances where dietary supplement consumption
is necessary [17]. Dietary supplements may be of great value to athletes who are vegan,
vegetarian, or are treating deficiencies [17].
Despite the high prevalence of athletes consuming dietary supplements, there was
minimal reporting on whether the dietary supplements were third party tested. Only one
study reported information on this and found that while over 90% of participants believed
it was vital to know whether the dietary supplement was third party tested, only 57%
purchased third-party tested supplements [
15].  Knowledge about nutrition and dietary
supplement use is vital to athletes choosing to consume dietary supplements. Accurate
information is needed to make informed decisions and protect against inadvertent doping
and dietary supplement misuse. The integration of nutritional-knowledge programs may
be highly valuable to increase the knowledge, beliefs and intentions of athletes who choose
to consume dietary supplements [16].
A wide range of team and individual sports were included in the studies within this
review. Interestingly, one study focused on wheelchair sport teams [34]. Aside from reasons
for dietary supplement use, another sex-based difference observed was generally, dietary
supplement consumption was higher in males than females.  Only a few studies found
contradictory results [
23,24,39].  Gender minorities, including transgender individuals
and  gender  non-binary  individuals,  were  not  included  in  this  analysis,  as  no  articles
targeted this population. Future studies should include and study minority populations
and paralympic sports to increase the generalizability of their results.
There are a number of limitations for the studies conducted to date on this topic.
Firstly, a combined 58% of studies included within this review were conducted in Spain
and the United States of America: mainly, by the same research team. Little research was
conducted in the United Kingdom, East Asia and Middle Eastern countries. Moreover, there
were no qualitative reviews on this topic. Qualitative studies provide a new perspective
and can provide great insight that allows for better understanding and interpretation of
177

Nutrients2022,14, 4109
results.  Studies included in this review relied on self-assessment measures for dietary
supplement intake information. Using self-reported data is subject to bias and is limited to
the participants ability to assess themselves accurately.
This scoping review does have some limitations.  First, our search was limited to
articles written in or translated to English language, so there is a possibility that relevant
articles written in other languages were left out. Additionally, the included studies were
not assessed for risk of bias, which is critical to identify the quality of evidence. Neverthe-
less, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the recent prevalence of dietary
supplement use among athletes.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, the lack of homogeneity among studies regarding the definition of
dietary supplements, reporting timeframes, and data collection methods complicates the
attempt to compare the findings.  Results from this review may contribute to future ed-
ucational intervention program initiatives to increase the knowledge of users on dietary
supplements, their benefits, and their risks and on the importance of their use under profes-
sional guidance. Given the higher prevalence of use of dietary supplements among athletes,
more research and initiatives are indispensable in this population as proper nutrition is an
extremely important factor in ensuring a high quality of life and optimum performance for
athletes.

Abstract:Sports supplements (SS) are commonly used by athletes to improve their performance. SS
use by competitive swimmers is reported to be prevalent but there is no evidence of such use by elite
swimmers, either male or female. The objective of this research was to study the patterns of SS use by
competitive swimmers based on sex and competitive levels (national and international); Methods:
Using the categories of the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS), a total of 102 competitive swimmers
(59 men and 43 women) completed a validated self-administered questionnaire on the use of SS;
(3) Results: Overall, 86.9% of swimmers had consumed SSs with no differences observed between
males and females (p= 0.247) or between competitive levels (p= 0.597).  The SS that were most
consumed by swimmers were caffeine (53.5%), sport drinks (52.5%), sport bars (51.5%), and vitamin
C (43.4%). SSs categorized as medical supplements were consumed significantly more frequently
by international swimmers (p= 0.012),  with significant differences also found in the level—sex
interaction (p= 0.049); (4) Conclusions: Compared to other sports disciplines, the prevalence of SS
consumption is high in competitive swimmers regardless of performance level or gender. However,
the consumption of medical supplements was greater in swimmers at a higher performance level.

1. Introduction
The main objective of competitive swimming is to complete a set distance (ranging
from 50 m to 1500 m in official swimming pool events) in the shortest possible time using
the front crawl, breaststroke, backstroke, or butterfly technique [1]. Swimming events can
last from approximately 20 s to 16 min approximately, and depending on the characteristics
of the event, the efforts require different energy systems, such as high-energy phosphagen,
glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation of carbohydrates, fats, or proteins [2].
The fact that swimming takes place in the water poses unique challenges for the
swimmer, with the obligation to reduce drag forces and to maximize propulsive forces
becoming a decisive factor in dictating the physiological and energetic demands rather than
the duration of the test itself [
3]. Training programs for elite competitors usually consist of a
large amount of high-intensity training [
4,5], although specific training demands depend on
the characteristics of the sprint, middle-distance, or distance event. For example, the aerobic
involvement in a 400 m front crawl event is 81%, while in the shorter events, such as 50 m
and 100 m front crawl, the aerobic contribution is 15.3% [2]. This also has consequences on
the different nutritional requirements for success in each discipline [2,6,7].
Previous studies have investigated strategies to increase performance by means of
better recovery [2,3,8–10] through the use of nutritional measures, such as sports supple-
ments [8,11,12].  The SSs should be considered as a supplement to the usual diet, which
is consumed with the aim of achieving specific performance benefits [
13].  Despite this,
Nutrients2022,14, 3218. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14153218https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients
181

Nutrients2022,14, 3218
only a small portion of current SSs on the market have been shown to produce significant
improvements in performance [13–16].  Some SS, such as sodium citrate or phosphate,
have been reported to provide a negligible benefit to exercise capacity [17–19]. Thus, it is
necessary to carry out a cost—benefit analysis based on the criteria for SS safety, efficacy,
and legality [15] prior to introducing supplements, providing strategies that allow us to
resist in the face of external agents [20].
Different international institutions periodically publish position stands that are elabo-
rated to guide the practice of supplementation, such as the Australian Institute of Sport
(AIS) which created the ABCD system, whereby each SS is classified according to the
level of scientific evidence [21]: SSs in group A present a high level of scientific evidence;
those in group B can have a positive effect in certain circumstances, but more evidence
is necessary; those in group C are supplements for which evidence is lacking; and those
in group D are prohibited substances.  At the same time, SSs are subdivided into sports
foods, medical supplements, and ergogenic aids. Several studies have reported the effects
of supplementation in athletes based on this classification system [14,22–25], and athletes
following a SS program under the AIS guide have displayed a greater consumption of SSs
with a high level of scientific evidence [26].
The reported range of SS consumption in sports is very wide and comprises between
30–95% of athletes [23,25,27]. Sex and level of performance are among the most important
variables for SS consumption, as SS consumption increases with the competitive level of
athletes and in men compared to women [13,23,25,28]. A higher rate of SS consumption
has been reported among swimmers (in comparison to other disciplines) as swimming was
ranked among the top four sports in terms of the SS use prevalence at the 2000 Sydney
Olympic Games [29,30]. The SS consumption patterns in competitive swimmers indicated
that all 23 swimmers surveyed in Sri Lanka had consumed SSs and had a daily intake of
3.4 different supplements [26]. However, these data were collected from swimmers with
a low competitive level, and, to the best of our knowledge, no other evidence on the SS
consumption prevalence or SS characteristics in elite swimmers has been observed.
Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze the use of SSs specifically in
competitive swimmers (national and international levels) and to describe the consumption
pattern according to sex and competitive level. It was hypothesized that swimmers of a
higher level of performance and male swimmers would present higher SS consumption.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants
A total of 102 competitive swimmers (59 men and 43 women) voluntarily participated
in this investigation.  All participants belonged to a federated swimming club and were
competing in national (n= 60) and/or international (n= 39) events at the time. Swimmers
of international level had taken part in international-level competitions with the national
team for at least two years.  Three swimmers from the original sample were eliminated
from the study because they did not have the required competitive national level; therefore,
99 swimmers were included in the final sample. All participants had an average of six days
of training per week, four hours of training per day, and an average of three days per week
of out-of-water training.
2.2. Instruments
The questionnaire used contained three main sections: the first one collected anthro-
pometric,  personal,  and social data of the respondent;  the second section covered the
practice of the sport activity and included 10 questions about, for example, the number
of years federated, the competitive level, years competing in the national team, the hours
of water training by week, the sessions of water training by week or dry-land training
sessions by week.  The last and most extensive section was related to SS consumption.
This section contained three questions on the type of diet the swimmers had, 12 questions
on the use and consumption of SS (i.e., what supplements are taken, for what reasons
182

Nutrients2022,14, 3218
are they taken, who advises to take them, when are they taken, what were the reasons
or where can the supplements be purchased), and, finally, two questions on the use of
banned substances. In addition, this part included the definition of sports supplements (SS)
proposed by Knapik [28] and an updated list of SSs. The response options included a time
frame such as whether swimmers took SSs for training, competition, or both and whether
they took them before, during, or after training and/or competition.
The questionnaire was previously validated in terms of its content, application, struc-
ture,  and  presentation  [31]  and  its  quality  was  evaluated  in  a  systematic  review  [28].
According to an eight-point scale that included assessments of sampling methods, sam-
pling frame, sample size, measurement tools, bias, response rate, statistical presentation,
and description of the participant sample, the quality of the questionnaire reached a 54%
score (57 out of 164 questionnaires evaluated) and it was considered adequate to obtain
accurate information on supplement use by athletes. It is worth noting its use in different
studies that have analyzed the consumption of SS in athletes [14,24,25,27,32].
2.3. Process
All swimmers who participated in this research did so voluntarily and only had
to complete a questionnaire on the use of supplements [
31].  Swimmers completed the
questionnaire between April and October 2019 in a web format that was prepared to facili-
tate its distribution (Google Forms, Google, Mountain View, CA, USA). The information
recorded in the questionnaires did not allow the identification of the swimmers, all of
whom remained anonymous. The participants were recruited with the help of the National
Swimming Federation, which distributed an e-mail with instructions for completion and an
online version of the questionnaire to all the teams with a national license. Thus, when the
swimmers went to their usual training pool, the characteristics of the study were explained
to them,  and consent was obtained from all of them.  The protocol complies with the
Declaration of Helsinki for human research and was approved by the Ethics Committee of
the local university committee.
2.4. Statistical Analysis
The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and the Levene test were applied to check for normality
and homoscedasticity. Quantitative variables were presented as an average (M)
±standard
deviation (SD), while qualitative variables were in percentages. For the analysis of possible
differences in the level of performance (international vs.  national) and of the possible
differences in sex with regard to the motivation, expectations, and contextualization of the
use of SS, a chi-square test (χ2) was performed. If statistical differences were reported, an
odds ratio (OR) was also performed.  As to the total SSs ingested, a Student’s T-test for
independent samples was carried out to analyze possible differences between the levels
of performance or between performance based on sex. The statistical level of significance
was set atp< 0.05. The statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for
Social Sciences (version 18.0 for Mac, SPSSTM Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
3. Results
The sample characteristics are reported in Table1. Male swimmers presented as taller
(p< 0.001) and heavier (p= 0.005) than female swimmers, although no anthropometric
differences were reported for level or level—sex. Additionally, no statistically significant
differences were found for the number of weekly training days or the number of strength
training days in relation to the competitive level, sex, or level—sex (p> 0.05). However,
national female swimmers performed more strength training days than did international
female swimmers (p= 0.044).  No differences were reported for level (p= 0.522) and sex
(p= 0.384)in the years of federated swimming with 20.2% of the sample federate for less
than 5 years, 39.4% between 5 and 8 years, and 40.4% for more than 9 years.

3.1. SS Consumption Characteristics
In relation to SS consumption characteristics, 6.1% of the sample said they were against
SS consumption in swimming, while 80.8% said they were in favor and 13.1% either did not
know or did not answer, with no statistically significant differences observed according to
sex (p= 0.841) or competitive level (p= 0.417). When asked if they had ever consumed SSs,
86.9% of the sample answered affirmatively, with no differences observed between men and
women (p= 0.247) or between swimmers at international and national levels(p= 0.597).
The main motivations for SS consumption were performance improvement (59.2%), health
care (14.6%), or to cover dietary deficits (10.0%), with no statistically significant differences
between sexes (p= 0.109) or between the level of swimmers (p= 0.530).
As shown in Figure1, SSs were most frequently purchased at specialized SS stores
(32.0%) and pharmacies (27.2%), followed by shopping centers (10.9%) and the Internet
(10.9%), with no differences between sexes (p= 0.193).  There were also no differences
between swimmers at the national and international levels (p= 0.822).
As can be seen in Figure2, the coach was the person who most frequently advised the
consumption of SSs (40.3%), followed by the dietitian—nutritionist (20.1%), the physician
(10.0%), the physical trainer (8.1%), family (6.7%), teammates (6.0%), friends (4.7%), or
others (4.1%). No significant differences were observed between sexes (p= 0.421) or levels
(p= 0.227).
Regarding when SSs were consumed within the season, most subjects reported con-
suming SSs during the competitive period (66.0%), followed by those who consumed them
only during the training period (23.0%), throughout the year (7.0%), or at other times (4.0%),
with no differences found according to sex (p= 0.702) or competitive level (p= 0.838). In
addition, no differences were found between men and women (p= 0.284), although differ-
ences were observed according to level (p< 0.001). International level swimmers presented
a greater mode of SS consumption before, during, and after exercise (39.5% vs.  18.6%),
whereas national level swimmers had a greater SS consumption mode exclusively before
(42.4% vs. 13.2%; OR = 2.56 [1.05–6.27]) or after (27.2% vs. 21.1%; OR = 1.29 [0.60–2.74])
exercise as compared to international level swimmers.
3.2. Type of SS Consumption
Group-level evidence of SSs (A, B, and C; see Table2) showed no statistical differences
in SS consumption for competitive level, sex, or level—sex (p> 0.05). As for the different
subgroups of group A, a higher consumption of medical supplements was found in inter-
national level swimmers (p= 0.012), reaching statistically significant differences in men
(p= 0.001)but not in women (p= 0.709).  In addition, higher consumption was found in
184

Nutrients2022,14, 3218
women at the national level as compared to men at the same competitive level (p= 0.013).
Finally, the subgroup “sport performance” showed higher consumption for national level
men as compared to national level women (p= 0.036).

Figure 2.Sources of information or advice on the use of supplements by elite swimmers according to
sex (up) and competitive level (down).
As can be seen in Table3, there was a consumption rate higher than 10% for 17 SSs
in total, with caffeine (53.5%), sports drinks (52.5%), sports bars (51.5%), and vitamin C
(43.4%) as the most consumed substances.  No differences were observed based on sex
for supplements with a consumption rate of at least 10%.  Males were observed to have
significantly lower consumption of vitamin complexes compared to females (p= 0.029;
OR = 0.33 [0.12–0.87]), but they had a higher consumption of creatine (p= 0.041; OR = 2.92
[1.10–7.72]), taurine (p> 0.001), and a trend toward significance in the case of whey protein
(p= 0.059; OR = 2.77 [0.99–7.7]). On the other hand, international level athletes presented a
greater iron intake (p< 0.001; OR = 5.77 [2.32–14.32]) than those at the national level.

4. Discussion
The aim of this study was to analyze SS use in international and national level swim-
mers, describing the pattern of consumption according to sex and competitive level. Al-
though previous studies [8,26,33–35] have examined SS consumption in competitive swim-
mers, to our knowledge, this is the first study to report on SS consumption in an extensive
sample of elite level swimmers. The results of the present study show a high prevalence of
SS use in competitive swimmers (86.9%) compared to other disciplines (30–95%), such as
elite sailors (52%) [14] or rugby players (65.3%) [25]. These data support a higher use of SS
in individual versus team sports (81% versus 58%) [36] and a prevalence similar to that of
previous research on swimming [8,28,30,33,35,36].
4.1. Characteristics of SS Consumption in Competitive Swimmers
High training volume of competitive swimmers including the large number of weekly
training sessions in and out the water [4] could explain the high prevalence of SS use in
competitive swimmers. Contrary to expectations, no significant differences were observed
between national and international level swimmers in the rate of SS consumption as has
been  shown  in  other  studies  [14,22].   This  could  be  explained  by  the  similar  training
volume of national and international caliber athletes, as defined by Mckay et al. [37] who
distinguished the elite-international and the highly trained-national by the competitive
standard. Finally, no differences were observed in the prevalence of SS use according to
sex, contrary to other recent studies [14,25,36] but in line with similar training volume in
swimming between gender.
The main reason for SS consumption in the present sample was to improve sports
performance (59.2%), regardless of gender or competitive level.  This motive for SS con-
sumption is common (45–77.8%) among elite athletes in different sports [14,32,36,38], and
it is consistent with the most used type of SS in the sample, that is, caffeine, which has
previously been reported to improve sports performance [21,39]. The most frequent places
of purchase of SS in this study, which were well beyond the rest, were specialized shops
(32%) and pharmacies (27.2%), a finding that is consistent with a recent study of elite sailors
by Caraballo et al. [14]. It is worth noting that online shopping, a current trend reported
in some studies [25,36], was not one of the most frequent places of purchase considering
the cases of biased and unreliable information, inclusion of undeclared pharmacological
substances on the label, and lack of specific legislation [27,40–43].
Although the source of information about SS should be professionals in the field
(sports doctors and/or dieticians—nutritionists), swimmers in the present research chose
coaches as the main source of information (40.3%) as in a very recent study in gym users
by Finamore [44] and the findings in a study of German athletes [45]. This demonstrates
some areas of improvement in SS consumption by competitive swimmers, since athletes
who receive advice from a professional have a higher consumption of SS for which there
is a high level of evidence [25].  It is noteworthy that most of the SS consumed were of
category A, which suggests that the coaches of our swimmers were very well informed and
instructed to advise on responsible consumption of SS to elite swimmers.
188

Nutrients2022,14, 3218
Most subjects reported consuming SS during the competitive period (66.0%), regardless
of gender or level of competition. This is related to the three most consumed SS substances
of caffeine, sports drinks, and sports bars as they tend to be used during competitive
periods. The timing of SS consumption coincided with data reported in similar studies of
elite athletes [14], although differences were observed between international and national
swimmers.   Higher level competitive swimmers had higher SS intake during exercise
compared with the higher pre-exercise SS intake of lower level swimmers.  The social
environment, training regimens, and competition place great demands on elite athletes [4];
perhaps for this reason, added to the demands of the competition itself, means that the
highest-level swimmers decide to resort to supplementation as an aid at the moment of
greatest sporting demand. This finding in the present investigation is interesting since none
of the other studies on swimmers has measured the moment of SSs [2].
The amount of SS consumed in the sample of competitive swimmers (5.45) was higher
than what has been reported on fencers (3.33) [23], rugby players (3.9) [25], and sailors
(3.9) [14] but lower than studies conducted with squash players (8.4) [32], rowers (16.28) [22],
all elite athletes. These data support the hypothesis that there is a difference in consumption
depending on the sport or sport modality [13,28,31], although we did not detect a lot of
differences in SS consumption by sex [25] or competitive level [28].
4.2. Type of SS Consumption in Competitive Swimmers
When dividing SSs according to the level of evidence (AIS classification), national level
men in group A had higher consumption than did women. Although women consumed
more SSs in medical supplement subgroup A (0.4 vs. 1.0), these differences in consumption
could be explained by the biggest differences in the sport performance subgroup (1.5 vs.
0.8). On the other hand, within the medical supplement subgroup, higher consumption
was observed at the international versus the national level for men and at the national
level  for  women  as  compared  to  men.   The  reason  for  these  differences  could  be  the
inclusion of iron in the medical supplement subgroup as it has been reported to be the most
consumed supplement by elite athletes in different sports [22,23,28,32,36] and specifically
by women [28,36]. Iron deficiency is one of the most prevalent nutritional deficiencies in
the athlete population, especially in women due to the increased demand for iron during
menstruation [46,47]; it is also prevalent at the end of the competitive period [48], which is
more demanding for international athletes. In addition, this supplement requires individual
dispensing and appropriate sports physician/scientist supervision, so it is reasonable that
international swimmers would have a higher intake.
Regarding the most consumed SS in the sample, differences were found according to
sex, with men consuming more creatine and taurine and showing a tendency in the case of
whey protein, and women consuming more vitamin complexes. These findings are related
to those obtained in previous studies in which iron and vitamin consumption were higher
for women and protein supplements (including creatine) were higher for men [28,49,50]. It
is worth noting that most of the SSs consumed in the present research belonged to group A
(more than 10% prevalence), which may suggest that the sample of swimmers was well
informed about the most effective supplements in their sport, even if coaches were the main
advisers about SSs, as mentioned above. For this reason, a good coach’s training-education
in this subject (with documents such as the IOC, AIS, or ISSN [13,21,51]) could be a key
aspect to correctly advise their swimmers at these levels.
Finally, the present study may present certain limitations that need to be noted for a
better interpretation of the results. First, the questionnaire which was used to assess the
consumption of dietary supplements in elite athletes collected information retrospectively,
and this could lead to inaccurate information on the number and/or type of supplements
reported. Even so, although the questionnaire collects the information retrospectively, a
validated and reliable questionnaire was used to assess the use of dietary supplements in
athletes, as was conducted in other studies of other sports with such a questionnaire [31].
These studies are proof that, despite these small limitations, such a questionnaire should not
189

Nutrients2022,14, 3218
affect your answers, guaranteeing their accuracy. Second, it is possible that swimmers could
have employed supplements but did not recognize their use at that time and, therefore, did
not report their use in the questionnaire, resulting in a false negative.
The analysis of SS consumption in this study was analyzed per unit, not per quantity.
The quantity should be subject to the weight of the athlete, so it is a very interesting topic
for future studies.
5. Conclusions
The present study indicated a high prevalence of SS consumption in competitive
swimmers compared to other disciplines, with caffeine, sports drinks, and sports bars being
the most consumed SSs.  Swimmers reported performance enhancement as the primary
motivation for SS consumption and, consequently, SS intake was most common during
the competitive period.  Differences in SS consumption were observed according to the
competitive level, with international level swimmers exhibiting (i) a greater consumption of
SSs during exercise (and not only before or after exercise) and (ii) a greater intake of medical
supplements (like iron) with a higher level of scientific evidence. In addition, differences
were observed by gender in the consumption of certain SSs such as creatine and taurine
or the vitamin complexes. These results provide the first evidence of SS consumption in
elite swimmers and demonstrate some specific patterns according to the high demands of
volume and intensity in the elite swimming training programs.
